1
00:02:38,385 --> 00:02:40,046
There's a very
pretty young woman

2
00:02:40,153 --> 00:02:42,212
crossing the street

3
00:02:42,322 --> 00:02:45,689
and I think she
may be coming here.

4
00:02:45,792 --> 00:02:47,589
Incidentally, I
have glanced over

5
00:02:47,694 --> 00:02:49,457
your latest
account of my work.

6
00:02:49,563 --> 00:02:51,497
Oh yes.

7
00:02:51,598 --> 00:02:54,499
Honestly I cannot
congratulate you upon it.

8
00:02:57,337 --> 00:03:01,671
Detection is, or ought
to be, an exact science.

9
00:03:01,775 --> 00:03:03,766
Observation deduction

10
00:03:03,877 --> 00:03:06,038
a cold and
unemotional subject.

11
00:03:06,146 --> 00:03:08,171
You have attempted
to tinge it
with romanticism,

12
00:03:08,281 --> 00:03:09,475
which has much
the same effect

13
00:03:09,583 --> 00:03:11,073
as if you worked a
love-story or an

14
00:03:11,184 --> 00:03:14,813
elopement into the fifth
proposition of Euclid.

15
00:03:14,921 --> 00:03:18,084
Who can match that?

16
00:03:18,191 --> 00:03:21,524
There's a young lady
to see you Mr. Holmes.

17
00:03:23,997 --> 00:03:25,589
It's Mary Morstan.

18
00:03:25,699 --> 00:03:27,724
I have no recollection
of the name.

19
00:03:30,537 --> 00:03:33,233
Don't go Doctor,
I may need you.

20
00:03:33,340 --> 00:03:35,308
I was right.

21
00:03:38,745 --> 00:03:40,406
Thank you.

22
00:03:40,513 --> 00:03:41,775
Miss Morstan.

23
00:03:41,882 --> 00:03:43,645
Good afternoon.

24
00:03:48,588 --> 00:03:49,919
I have come to
you Mr. Holmes

25
00:03:50,023 --> 00:03:52,014
because you once
enabled my employer,

26
00:03:52,125 --> 00:03:53,717
Mrs. Cecil Forrester,

27
00:03:53,827 --> 00:03:56,887
to unravel a minor
domestic complication.

28
00:03:56,997 --> 00:03:58,396
She was much impressed

29
00:03:58,498 --> 00:04:01,365
with your kindness
and skill.

30
00:04:01,468 --> 00:04:03,095
Thank you.

31
00:04:15,081 --> 00:04:17,413
I can hardly imagine
anything more strange,

32
00:04:17,517 --> 00:04:20,577
more utterly
inexplicable,

33
00:04:20,687 --> 00:04:22,882
than the situation in
which I find myself.

34
00:04:22,989 --> 00:04:25,514
State your case.

35
00:04:25,625 --> 00:04:27,217
You will, I am
sure, excuse me.

36
00:04:27,327 --> 00:04:30,956
If your friend would be
good enough to remain,

37
00:04:31,064 --> 00:04:33,794
he might be of
inestimable service to me.

38
00:04:33,900 --> 00:04:35,492
Of course.

39
00:04:45,312 --> 00:04:49,646
Briefly the
facts are these.

40
00:04:49,749 --> 00:04:53,310
My father was an officer
in an Indian regiment.

41
00:04:53,420 --> 00:04:56,753
My mother died when I
was still quite a child

42
00:04:56,856 --> 00:05:00,155
and he was forced
to send me home,

43
00:05:00,260 --> 00:05:03,627
despite the fact that I
had no relatives here.

44
00:05:03,730 --> 00:05:05,129
I was placed in a

45
00:05:05,231 --> 00:05:06,892
comfortable boarding
establishment

46
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,695
at Edinburgh, and
I remained there

47
00:05:08,802 --> 00:05:10,565
until I was 1 7
years of age.

48
00:05:10,670 --> 00:05:14,037
In that same
year my father,

49
00:05:14,140 --> 00:05:18,236
who was a senior
captain of his regiment,

50
00:05:18,345 --> 00:05:24,341
obtained 12 months'
leave and returned home.

51
00:05:24,451 --> 00:05:25,941
He telegraphed to me
from London to say

52
00:05:26,052 --> 00:05:28,111
that he had
arrived all safe

53
00:05:28,221 --> 00:05:30,280
and directed me to
come down at once,

54
00:05:30,390 --> 00:05:33,985
giving the Langham
Hotel as his address.

55
00:05:34,094 --> 00:05:37,063
His message,
as I remember,

56
00:05:37,163 --> 00:05:40,758
was full of love
and kindness.

57
00:05:40,867 --> 00:05:42,232
On reaching London

58
00:05:42,335 --> 00:05:44,132
I drove straight to
the Langham Hotel

59
00:05:44,237 --> 00:05:46,228
and was informed
that Captain Morstan

60
00:05:46,339 --> 00:05:48,000
was staying there,

61
00:05:48,108 --> 00:05:49,598
but that he had gone
out the night before

62
00:05:49,709 --> 00:05:51,836
and had not returned.

63
00:05:51,945 --> 00:05:56,006
So I waited

64
00:05:56,116 --> 00:05:58,607
all day

65
00:05:58,718 --> 00:06:03,178
without news of him.

66
00:06:03,289 --> 00:06:07,316
And that night,

67
00:06:07,427 --> 00:06:12,262
on the advice of the
manager of the hotel,

68
00:06:12,365 --> 00:06:17,632
I communicated
with the police,

69
00:06:17,737 --> 00:06:19,170
the next day
we advertised

70
00:06:19,272 --> 00:06:23,231
in all the newspapers.

71
00:06:23,343 --> 00:06:26,506
Our inquiries
led to no result

72
00:06:26,613 --> 00:06:28,945
from that day to this

73
00:06:29,049 --> 00:06:30,778
no word has
ever been heard

74
00:06:30,884 --> 00:06:33,250
of my unfortunate
father.

75
00:06:41,795 --> 00:06:44,992
He came home with his
heart so full of hope

76
00:06:45,098 --> 00:06:46,656
to find some peace,

77
00:06:46,766 --> 00:06:48,666
some comfort,

78
00:06:48,768 --> 00:06:50,759
and instead

79
00:06:57,944 --> 00:07:01,107
The date?

80
00:07:01,214 --> 00:07:02,340
The 3rd of December

81
00:07:02,449 --> 00:07:07,216
exactly 1 0 years ago.

82
00:07:07,320 --> 00:07:09,447
His luggage?

83
00:07:09,556 --> 00:07:13,287
Remained at the hotel.

84
00:07:13,393 --> 00:07:15,725
Oh there was nothing in
it to suggest a clue --

85
00:07:15,829 --> 00:07:18,093
some clothes, some books,

86
00:07:18,198 --> 00:07:20,063
and a considerable
number of curiosities

87
00:07:20,166 --> 00:07:22,600
from the
Andaman Islands.

88
00:07:25,371 --> 00:07:26,770
My father had been
one of the officers

89
00:07:26,873 --> 00:07:28,431
in charge of the
convict-guard there.

90
00:07:28,541 --> 00:07:30,133
Watson this
place is a mess.

91
00:07:30,243 --> 00:07:31,904
Had he any
friends in town?

92
00:07:32,011 --> 00:07:34,502
Only one that
we know of

93
00:07:34,614 --> 00:07:37,412
Major Sholto, of
his old regiment,

94
00:07:37,517 --> 00:07:40,714
the 34th Bombay
Infantry.

95
00:07:40,820 --> 00:07:43,288
We communicated with
the Major, of course,

96
00:07:43,389 --> 00:07:46,290
but he did not
seem to know

97
00:07:46,392 --> 00:07:48,326
that his brother
officer was in England.

98
00:07:48,428 --> 00:07:50,225
It's a singular case.

99
00:07:56,469 --> 00:07:59,734
I have not yet
communicated to you

100
00:07:59,839 --> 00:08:02,171
the most singular part.

101
00:08:04,277 --> 00:08:05,574
4 years later

102
00:08:05,678 --> 00:08:07,509
an advertisement had
appeared in the Times

103
00:08:07,614 --> 00:08:09,514
asking for the address
of Miss Mary Morstan,

104
00:08:09,616 --> 00:08:11,481
and stating that it
would be to her advantage

105
00:08:11,584 --> 00:08:13,745
to come forward.

106
00:08:13,853 --> 00:08:16,879
There was no
name appended.

107
00:08:16,990 --> 00:08:18,321
I had at the time

108
00:08:18,424 --> 00:08:20,415
just entered the family
of Mrs. Cecil Forrester

109
00:08:20,527 --> 00:08:22,256
in the capacity
of governess

110
00:08:22,362 --> 00:08:24,387
and on her advice I
published my address

111
00:08:24,497 --> 00:08:27,432
in the advertisement
column.

112
00:08:27,534 --> 00:08:29,934
That same day there
appeared through the post

113
00:08:30,036 --> 00:08:34,803
a small cardboard
box addressed to me,

114
00:08:34,908 --> 00:08:37,001
which I found to contain

115
00:08:37,110 --> 00:08:40,443
a very large and
lustrous pearl.

116
00:08:40,547 --> 00:08:42,845
No word of writing
was enclosed.

117
00:08:42,949 --> 00:08:46,476
And since then every
year upon the same date

118
00:08:46,586 --> 00:08:48,611
there has always
appeared a similar box,

119
00:08:48,721 --> 00:08:50,154
containing a
similar pearl,

120
00:08:50,256 --> 00:08:52,781
with no clue as
to the sender.

121
00:08:52,892 --> 00:08:54,359
They have been
pronounced by an expert

122
00:08:54,460 --> 00:08:56,121
to be of a rare variety

123
00:08:56,229 --> 00:09:00,256
and of considerable value.

124
00:09:00,366 --> 00:09:01,663
You can see for yourself

125
00:09:01,768 --> 00:09:04,896
that they are
very handsome.

126
00:09:11,778 --> 00:09:16,442
Your case is
most interesting.

127
00:09:16,549 --> 00:09:19,074
Something else has
occurred to you?

128
00:09:19,185 --> 00:09:22,018
Yes, and no
later than today.

129
00:09:22,121 --> 00:09:25,318
That is why I
have come to you.

130
00:09:25,425 --> 00:09:29,555
This letter
arrived through the
post this morning,

131
00:09:29,662 --> 00:09:32,688
which you will perhaps
read for yourself.

132
00:09:32,799 --> 00:09:35,097
Envelope please.

133
00:09:37,103 --> 00:09:39,697
London postmark,
October 7th.

134
00:09:39,806 --> 00:09:42,707
Man's thumb
mark on corner

135
00:09:42,809 --> 00:09:46,472
probably the postman.

136
00:09:46,579 --> 00:09:47,944
Best quality paper.

137
00:09:48,047 --> 00:09:49,878
Sixpence a packet.

138
00:09:49,983 --> 00:09:52,508
Particular man in
his stationery.

139
00:09:52,619 --> 00:09:54,712
Watson.

140
00:09:54,821 --> 00:09:58,018
Be at the third
pillar from the left

141
00:09:58,124 --> 00:09:59,751
outside the
Lyceum Theatre

142
00:09:59,859 --> 00:10:01,690
tonight at
seven o'clock.

143
00:10:01,794 --> 00:10:03,955
If you are distrustful
bring 2 friends.

144
00:10:04,063 --> 00:10:07,464
You are a wronged woman
and shall have justice.

145
00:10:07,567 --> 00:10:08,864
Do not bring the police.

146
00:10:08,968 --> 00:10:10,663
If you do, all
will be in vain.

147
00:10:10,770 --> 00:10:12,397
Your unknown friend.

148
00:10:12,505 --> 00:10:13,836
Well, really,

149
00:10:13,940 --> 00:10:15,339
this is a very pretty
little problem.

150
00:10:15,441 --> 00:10:16,874
What do you intend
to do, Miss Morstan?

151
00:10:16,976 --> 00:10:18,534
Well that is exactly
what I want to ask you.

152
00:10:18,645 --> 00:10:20,909
Well then you and I
shall go together.

153
00:10:21,014 --> 00:10:22,914
Dr. Watson is
the very man.

154
00:10:23,016 --> 00:10:26,281
Your correspondent
says 2 friends.

155
00:10:26,386 --> 00:10:28,149
But would he come?

156
00:10:28,254 --> 00:10:29,653
I shall be proud and happy

157
00:10:29,756 --> 00:10:32,486
if I can be
of any service.

158
00:10:32,592 --> 00:10:34,719
You are both very kind.

159
00:10:34,827 --> 00:10:35,919
I have led a retired life

160
00:10:36,029 --> 00:10:38,759
and have no friends
whom I could appeal to.

161
00:10:38,865 --> 00:10:40,924
If I am here at 6 it
will do, I suppose?

162
00:10:41,034 --> 00:10:42,467
Yes but you must
not be later.

163
00:10:42,568 --> 00:10:44,126
Goodbye Miss Morstan.

164
00:10:44,237 --> 00:10:46,296
Goodbye Mr. Holmes.

165
00:10:46,406 --> 00:10:47,668
Au revoir.

166
00:10:47,774 --> 00:10:49,173
Au revoir.

167
00:11:03,122 --> 00:11:05,283
Buy a flower dearie.

168
00:11:05,391 --> 00:11:07,256
Buy a flower.

169
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:09,590
Aw come on dearie.

170
00:11:09,696 --> 00:11:12,494
Excuse me.

171
00:11:12,598 --> 00:11:16,796
What a very
attractive woman

172
00:11:16,903 --> 00:11:18,200
It is of the
first importance

173
00:11:18,304 --> 00:11:19,703
not to allow your
judgment to be biased

174
00:11:19,806 --> 00:11:21,467
by personal qualities.

175
00:11:21,574 --> 00:11:23,098
A client to me
is a mere unit,

176
00:11:23,209 --> 00:11:24,608
a factor in of
the problem.

177
00:11:24,711 --> 00:11:26,872
Holmes, you are
a automaton

178
00:11:26,979 --> 00:11:28,606
and a calculating
machine.

179
00:11:28,715 --> 00:11:31,275
There's something
positively inhuman
in you at times.

180
00:11:31,384 --> 00:11:32,510
I assure you

181
00:11:32,618 --> 00:11:34,176
the most winning
woman I ever knew

182
00:11:34,287 --> 00:11:36,221
was hanged for poisoning
3 little children

183
00:11:36,322 --> 00:11:38,256
for their
insurance money,

184
00:11:38,358 --> 00:11:40,622
and the most repellent
man of my acquaintance

185
00:11:40,727 --> 00:11:42,922
is a philanthropist
who has spent nearly

186
00:11:43,029 --> 00:11:45,088
a quarter of a million
upon the London poor.

187
00:11:45,198 --> 00:11:47,723
However, in this case,

188
00:11:47,834 --> 00:11:49,392
I never make exceptions.

189
00:11:49,502 --> 00:11:50,901
An exception
disproves the rule.

190
00:11:51,003 --> 00:11:52,937
I'm going out. I'll
see you in an hour.

191
00:12:07,820 --> 00:12:09,845
<i>Had he any
friends in town?</i>

192
00:12:09,956 --> 00:12:12,584
<i>Only one that
we know of,</i>

193
00:12:12,692 --> 00:12:15,889
<i>Major Sholto of
his own regiment.</i>

194
00:12:23,970 --> 00:12:25,597
There is no great
mystery in this matter

195
00:12:25,705 --> 00:12:27,673
the facts appear to admit
of only one explanation.

196
00:12:27,774 --> 00:12:29,674
Oh so you've
solved it already?

197
00:12:29,776 --> 00:12:31,073
I have found,

198
00:12:31,177 --> 00:12:32,542
on consulting the back
files of the Times,

199
00:12:32,645 --> 00:12:34,135
that Major Sholto,
of Upper Norwood,

200
00:12:34,247 --> 00:12:35,908
late of the 34th
Bombay Infantry,

201
00:12:36,015 --> 00:12:39,348
died just 6 years ago.

202
00:12:39,452 --> 00:12:42,182
Mrs. Hudson you're
dreadfully under foot.

203
00:12:43,389 --> 00:12:44,583
I may be very
obtuse, Holmes,

204
00:12:44,690 --> 00:12:45,987
but I fail to see
what this suggests.

205
00:12:46,092 --> 00:12:47,286
Really?

206
00:12:47,393 --> 00:12:48,655
You surprise me.

207
00:12:48,761 --> 00:12:49,989
Now look at it
this way, then.

208
00:12:50,096 --> 00:12:51,825
Captain Morstan
disappears.

209
00:12:51,931 --> 00:12:53,330
The only person in London

210
00:12:53,433 --> 00:12:55,401
whom he could have
visited is Major Sholto.

211
00:12:55,501 --> 00:12:56,900
Major Sholto denies
having heard

212
00:12:57,003 --> 00:12:58,664
that he was
even in London.

213
00:12:58,771 --> 00:13:00,739
4 years later Sholto dies.

214
00:13:00,840 --> 00:13:03,331
Within a week of his death

215
00:13:03,443 --> 00:13:04,876
Captain Morstan's daughter

216
00:13:04,977 --> 00:13:06,467
receives a
valuable present,

217
00:13:06,579 --> 00:13:08,240
which is repeated
from year to year

218
00:13:08,347 --> 00:13:10,110
and now culminates
in a letter,

219
00:13:10,216 --> 00:13:12,912
which describes her
as a wronged woman.

220
00:13:13,019 --> 00:13:15,078
Now what wrong can
it possibly refer to

221
00:13:15,188 --> 00:13:18,248
except this deprivation
of her father?

222
00:13:18,357 --> 00:13:20,120
Tape measure,

223
00:13:20,226 --> 00:13:21,818
gun.

224
00:13:24,030 --> 00:13:25,156
And why should
these presents

225
00:13:25,264 --> 00:13:26,595
begin immediately
after Sholto's death

226
00:13:26,699 --> 00:13:29,224
unless it is that
Sholto's heir

227
00:13:29,335 --> 00:13:30,529
knows something
of the mystery

228
00:13:30,636 --> 00:13:32,695
and desires to
make compensation?

229
00:13:35,107 --> 00:13:37,234
Are you ready Watson?

230
00:13:37,343 --> 00:13:39,777
And waiting.

231
00:13:39,879 --> 00:13:41,210
Have you any
alternative theory

232
00:13:41,314 --> 00:13:42,747
that will meet the facts?

233
00:13:42,849 --> 00:13:44,146
But what a strange
compensation!

234
00:13:44,250 --> 00:13:45,774
And how strangely made!

235
00:13:45,885 --> 00:13:47,443
What time is it?

236
00:13:47,553 --> 00:13:49,578
It's a quarter
past the hour.

237
00:14:01,167 --> 00:14:02,361
Evening Ellis.

238
00:14:02,468 --> 00:14:03,457
Evening sir.

239
00:14:05,471 --> 00:14:06,733
Why should somebody

240
00:14:06,839 --> 00:14:08,101
write her a letter now,

241
00:14:08,207 --> 00:14:09,799
rather than 6 years ago?

242
00:14:09,909 --> 00:14:12,104
Again, the letter speaks
of giving her justice.

243
00:14:12,211 --> 00:14:13,439
What justice can she have?

244
00:14:13,546 --> 00:14:14,740
It is too much to suppose

245
00:14:14,847 --> 00:14:16,280
that her father
is still alive

246
00:14:16,382 --> 00:14:17,781
and there's no
other injustice

247
00:14:17,884 --> 00:14:19,476
in her case that
you know of.

248
00:14:19,585 --> 00:14:21,519
There are difficulties

249
00:14:21,621 --> 00:14:23,851
but there are
always difficulties.

250
00:14:28,728 --> 00:14:29,592
Good evening Mr Holmes.

251
00:14:29,695 --> 00:14:30,662
I do hope I'm not...

252
00:14:30,763 --> 00:14:31,422
Good evening.

253
00:14:40,139 --> 00:14:41,163
By the way,

254
00:14:41,274 --> 00:14:43,401
a curious paper was
found in Papa's desk,

255
00:14:43,509 --> 00:14:45,977
which nobody
could understand.

256
00:14:46,078 --> 00:14:47,875
I don't suppose it is of
the slightest importance,

257
00:14:47,980 --> 00:14:50,107
but I thought you
might like to see it,

258
00:14:50,216 --> 00:14:53,049
so I brought it with me.

259
00:14:53,152 --> 00:14:55,620
The paper appears to be
of Indian manufacture.

260
00:14:55,721 --> 00:15:00,420
At some point it's
been pinned to a board.

261
00:15:00,526 --> 00:15:03,051
The diagram upon it
appears to be the plan

262
00:15:03,162 --> 00:15:05,255
of part of a
large building

263
00:15:05,364 --> 00:15:09,562
with numerous halls,
corridors, and passages.

264
00:15:09,669 --> 00:15:12,934
There's a cross
in red ink,

265
00:15:13,039 --> 00:15:17,373
and on the side is
written '3.37 from left.'

266
00:15:17,476 --> 00:15:20,809
There is a curious
hieroglyphic,

267
00:15:20,913 --> 00:15:23,939
The sign of four

268
00:15:24,050 --> 00:15:25,847
Kartar Singh,
Indrajit Singh,

269
00:15:25,952 --> 00:15:28,716
Jagodish Singh,
Jonathan Small.

270
00:15:28,821 --> 00:15:31,984
It appears it has
been kept carefully
in a pocketbook,

271
00:15:32,091 --> 00:15:34,651
for the one side is
as clean as the other.

272
00:15:34,760 --> 00:15:37,991
It was in his pocketbook
that we found it.

273
00:15:38,097 --> 00:15:41,066
Preserve it carefully,
Miss Morstan.

274
00:15:41,167 --> 00:15:43,567
I begin to suspect
that this case may be

275
00:15:43,669 --> 00:15:45,227
much deeper
and more subtle

276
00:15:45,338 --> 00:15:47,932
than I ever
first supposed.

277
00:16:31,350 --> 00:16:33,215
Hey, are you the parties

278
00:16:33,319 --> 00:16:35,184
who come with
Miss Morstan?

279
00:16:35,287 --> 00:16:36,549
I'm Miss Morstan,

280
00:16:36,656 --> 00:16:38,487
and these 2 gentlemen
are my companions.

281
00:16:38,591 --> 00:16:40,582
I must ask you to
give me your word

282
00:16:40,693 --> 00:16:42,251
that neither of
your companions

283
00:16:42,361 --> 00:16:43,760
is a police officer.

284
00:16:43,863 --> 00:16:45,854
I give you my word.

285
00:17:23,269 --> 00:17:26,568
Sahib awaits you.

286
00:17:26,672 --> 00:17:28,537
Show them in, Khitmutgar.

287
00:17:28,641 --> 00:17:30,700
Show them
straight in to me.

288
00:17:35,047 --> 00:17:39,143
Your servant,
Miss Morstan.

289
00:17:39,251 --> 00:17:41,048
Your servant, gentlemen.

290
00:17:41,153 --> 00:17:43,053
Come in.

291
00:17:43,155 --> 00:17:43,814
Come in.

292
00:17:43,923 --> 00:17:44,787
Come in.

293
00:17:44,890 --> 00:17:48,257
Come in to my
little sanctum.

294
00:17:48,360 --> 00:17:50,794
I trust you have
no objection

295
00:17:50,896 --> 00:17:54,593
to tobacco smoke?

296
00:17:54,700 --> 00:17:56,793
The balsamic odor

297
00:17:56,902 --> 00:17:59,962
of Eastern tobacco?

298
00:18:00,072 --> 00:18:03,166
I am a little nervous

299
00:18:03,275 --> 00:18:08,303
and I find my hookah
to be an invaluable...

300
00:18:21,694 --> 00:18:23,218
sedative.

301
00:18:26,031 --> 00:18:28,898
You will excuse
me Mr. Sholto

302
00:18:29,001 --> 00:18:31,299
but I am here
at your request

303
00:18:31,403 --> 00:18:32,870
to learn something,

304
00:18:32,972 --> 00:18:34,997
which you desire
to tell me?

305
00:18:35,107 --> 00:18:37,132
It is getting very
late and I should wish

306
00:18:37,243 --> 00:18:39,575
the interview to be
as short as possible.

307
00:18:41,714 --> 00:18:44,774
Well it must
take some time.

308
00:18:44,884 --> 00:18:49,912
For we have to
go to Norwood

309
00:18:50,022 --> 00:18:54,322
to see brother
Bartholomew.

310
00:18:54,426 --> 00:19:00,058
We must all see

311
00:19:00,166 --> 00:19:03,033
if we can get the better

312
00:19:03,135 --> 00:19:07,663
of brother
Bartholomew.

313
00:19:07,773 --> 00:19:11,368
He is angry with me for

314
00:19:11,477 --> 00:19:17,438
taking the course that
has seemed right to me.

315
00:19:17,550 --> 00:19:19,643
You cannot imagine

316
00:19:19,752 --> 00:19:23,779
what a terrible
fellow he is

317
00:19:23,889 --> 00:19:28,155
when he is angry.

318
00:19:28,260 --> 00:19:29,887
If we are to
go to Norwood,

319
00:19:29,995 --> 00:19:31,326
it would
perhaps be as well

320
00:19:31,430 --> 00:19:32,727
if we were start at once.

321
00:19:32,832 --> 00:19:34,060
No.

322
00:19:34,166 --> 00:19:36,726
No that would hardly do.

323
00:19:36,836 --> 00:19:38,167
I don't know what
he would say

324
00:19:38,270 --> 00:19:40,363
if we came upon him
in that sudden way.

325
00:19:40,472 --> 00:19:42,940
No I must prepare you

326
00:19:43,042 --> 00:19:47,172
by showing you
where we all stand

327
00:19:47,279 --> 00:19:50,214
to each other.

328
00:19:50,316 --> 00:19:57,745
I must lay the
facts before you,

329
00:19:57,857 --> 00:20:01,054
as I know them myself.

330
00:20:05,731 --> 00:20:11,226
My father, the late
Major John Sholto,

331
00:20:11,337 --> 00:20:15,205
came to live at
Pondicherry Lodge

332
00:20:15,307 --> 00:20:17,673
in Upper Norwood

333
00:20:17,776 --> 00:20:21,940
some 1 1 years ago.

334
00:20:22,047 --> 00:20:25,016
And he had
prospered in India

335
00:20:25,117 --> 00:20:27,415
and brought back with him

336
00:20:27,519 --> 00:20:29,851
a considerable
sum of money,

337
00:20:29,955 --> 00:20:33,049
a collection of
valuable curiosities,

338
00:20:33,158 --> 00:20:36,685
and a staff of
native servants.

339
00:20:36,795 --> 00:20:38,763
With these advantages

340
00:20:38,864 --> 00:20:41,628
he lived in great luxury.

341
00:20:41,734 --> 00:20:45,101
My brother and I were at
university at the time.

342
00:20:45,204 --> 00:20:47,604
We did know, however,

343
00:20:47,706 --> 00:20:49,264
that some mystery,

344
00:20:49,375 --> 00:20:51,639
some positive danger,

345
00:20:51,744 --> 00:20:54,679
overhung our father.

346
00:20:56,849 --> 00:20:59,283
He was very fearful

347
00:20:59,385 --> 00:21:01,910
of going out alone,

348
00:21:02,021 --> 00:21:05,479
and he employed
2 prizefighters

349
00:21:05,591 --> 00:21:06,990
to guard him.

350
00:21:07,092 --> 00:21:09,822
Williams, who drove
you here tonight,

351
00:21:09,929 --> 00:21:11,726
was one of them.

352
00:21:11,830 --> 00:21:13,297
For some reason,

353
00:21:13,399 --> 00:21:15,026
he never told anyone,

354
00:21:15,134 --> 00:21:16,897
my father had a
marked aversion

355
00:21:17,002 --> 00:21:20,529
to men with wooden legs.

356
00:21:20,639 --> 00:21:22,004
On one occasion

357
00:21:22,107 --> 00:21:24,234
he actually fired
his revolver

358
00:21:24,343 --> 00:21:27,312
at a one-legged man.

359
00:21:27,413 --> 00:21:31,281
A harmless tradesman
as it turned out.

360
00:21:37,923 --> 00:21:39,447
I remember we
have to pay

361
00:21:39,558 --> 00:21:42,891
a considerable sum
to hush it up.

362
00:21:44,663 --> 00:21:47,530
Then suddenly

363
00:21:49,702 --> 00:21:53,536
my father
received a letter

364
00:21:55,007 --> 00:21:58,966
It was a great
shock to him.

365
00:22:10,055 --> 00:22:11,784
Out.

366
00:22:11,890 --> 00:22:13,721
Out of the room!

367
00:22:13,826 --> 00:22:16,386
Out of the room!

368
00:22:29,508 --> 00:22:34,275
What was in the letter

369
00:22:34,380 --> 00:22:38,612
we could never discover?

370
00:22:38,717 --> 00:22:42,050
For years my father
had suffered

371
00:22:42,154 --> 00:22:44,816
with an
enlarged spleen

372
00:22:44,923 --> 00:22:46,720
and from that moment on

373
00:22:46,825 --> 00:22:49,521
he became rapidly worse.

374
00:22:49,628 --> 00:22:54,497
But one night the
doctor informed us
there was no hope

375
00:22:54,600 --> 00:22:58,161
and that he wished
to make a last
communication to us.

376
00:23:01,540 --> 00:23:03,770
My dear family,

377
00:23:08,047 --> 00:23:10,845
when we were in India

378
00:23:10,949 --> 00:23:15,079
my friend, Morstan and I,

379
00:23:15,187 --> 00:23:17,519
came into possession

380
00:23:17,623 --> 00:23:21,582
of a considerable
treasure.

381
00:23:21,693 --> 00:23:27,290
I brought it home
with me to this house,

382
00:23:27,399 --> 00:23:29,367
where it's still alive.

383
00:23:33,405 --> 00:23:37,034
On the day, Mr. Morstan,

384
00:23:37,142 --> 00:23:40,441
had arrived home
from the East.

385
00:23:40,546 --> 00:23:45,643
He came straight
to this house

386
00:23:45,751 --> 00:23:49,346
to claim his share.

387
00:23:49,455 --> 00:23:51,480
We gave our word Sholto.

388
00:23:51,590 --> 00:23:52,784
A promise.

389
00:23:52,891 --> 00:23:55,155
We gave our word
and our oath.

390
00:23:55,260 --> 00:23:57,455
another time,

391
00:23:57,563 --> 00:23:59,190
another life,
another world,

392
00:23:59,298 --> 00:24:01,095
a solemn promise.

393
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:03,634
You tried to
betray me Morstan.

394
00:24:03,735 --> 00:24:10,106
If you dare to
cross me...

395
00:24:10,209 --> 00:24:12,302
My God.

396
00:24:12,411 --> 00:24:14,538
The man is dead Altada.

397
00:24:14,646 --> 00:24:16,238
You have nothing
to fear Sir.

398
00:24:16,348 --> 00:24:18,213
I will arrange everything.

399
00:24:18,317 --> 00:24:22,151
And soon it was
done Miss Morstan,

400
00:24:22,254 --> 00:24:24,916
in secrecy of course

401
00:24:25,023 --> 00:24:27,856
but with respect.

402
00:24:27,960 --> 00:24:30,360
This is disgraceful
Mister Sholto.

403
00:24:30,462 --> 00:24:33,022
Your father's behavior
was quite unforgivable.

404
00:24:33,132 --> 00:24:35,532
Please Doctor.

405
00:24:38,203 --> 00:24:39,500
I knew in my heart

406
00:24:39,605 --> 00:24:41,573
that he was dead.

407
00:24:44,076 --> 00:24:46,237
My father was
not alone then.

408
00:24:49,648 --> 00:24:52,242
And I'm glad he
didn't suffer.

409
00:24:52,351 --> 00:24:55,252
You're very brave
Miss Morstan.

410
00:24:55,354 --> 00:24:56,719
What concerns me now

411
00:24:56,822 --> 00:24:59,086
is the wishing
for this quarrel.

412
00:24:59,191 --> 00:25:00,920
I cannot imagine
how my father

413
00:25:01,026 --> 00:25:03,517
came to be involved
with that treasure.

414
00:25:03,629 --> 00:25:08,123
I'm afraid that is
not clear Miss Morstan

415
00:25:08,233 --> 00:25:10,929
I can only tell you

416
00:25:11,036 --> 00:25:14,563
my father's instructions
concerning it.

417
00:25:26,118 --> 00:25:28,018
The greed.

418
00:25:29,521 --> 00:25:31,011
accursed greed
that has been

419
00:25:31,123 --> 00:25:33,717
my besetting thing
throughout my life

420
00:25:33,825 --> 00:25:37,784
has robbed her
of the treasure.

421
00:25:37,896 --> 00:25:40,865
Half of which, at least,

422
00:25:40,966 --> 00:25:43,867
should be hers.

423
00:25:43,969 --> 00:25:53,503
You see that
chaplet there.

424
00:25:53,612 --> 00:25:59,710
I had the design of
sending it to her

425
00:25:59,818 --> 00:26:06,815
but could not bear
to part with it.

426
00:26:06,925 --> 00:26:08,756
You

427
00:26:08,860 --> 00:26:11,158
my sons

428
00:26:11,263 --> 00:26:13,254
must see that
Miss Morstan

429
00:26:13,365 --> 00:26:17,768
gets her share
of the treasure.

430
00:26:30,916 --> 00:26:33,749
Get him away.

431
00:26:33,852 --> 00:26:37,811
For Christ's sake
get him away.

432
00:26:37,923 --> 00:26:41,188
We ran to the window
and out into the garden

433
00:26:41,293 --> 00:26:44,421
but the intruder was gone.

434
00:26:44,529 --> 00:26:47,396
My father was dead.

435
00:26:47,499 --> 00:26:51,902
We soon had more striking
proof that there were

436
00:26:52,004 --> 00:26:55,030
secret agencies that
work all around us.

437
00:26:55,140 --> 00:27:00,407
The next day my father's
bedroom was broken into

438
00:27:00,512 --> 00:27:06,508
and this was fixed
to his chest.

439
00:27:08,787 --> 00:27:10,778
Remarkable.

440
00:27:10,889 --> 00:27:14,552
It is the Sikkh symbol
for the numeral 4.

441
00:27:18,463 --> 00:27:20,158
What the paper means

442
00:27:20,265 --> 00:27:22,665
and who our secret
visitor or visitors were

443
00:27:22,768 --> 00:27:25,362
we never found out.

444
00:27:30,309 --> 00:27:32,937
And my brother and
I were much excited

445
00:27:33,045 --> 00:27:34,740
as you could imagine

446
00:27:34,846 --> 00:27:36,541
of the treasure that
my father had spoken

447
00:27:36,648 --> 00:27:38,548
but try as we might
we couldn't find it.

448
00:27:38,650 --> 00:27:40,447
It was maddened to think
that the hiding place

449
00:27:40,552 --> 00:27:43,715
was on his very
lips when he died.

450
00:27:43,822 --> 00:27:47,656
We could judge the
splendor of the riches

451
00:27:47,759 --> 00:27:49,818
by the chaplet, which
he had taken out.

452
00:27:49,928 --> 00:27:52,123
The pearls were
evidently of great value,

453
00:27:52,230 --> 00:27:56,496
and my brother was averse
to part with them,

454
00:27:56,601 --> 00:27:59,035
for, between friends,

455
00:27:59,137 --> 00:28:03,005
he was a little inclined
to my father's fault.

456
00:28:03,108 --> 00:28:05,372
And it was all I could
do was to persuade him

457
00:28:05,477 --> 00:28:07,775
to allow me to
send Miss Morstan

458
00:28:07,879 --> 00:28:10,871
a detached pearl at
regular intervals

459
00:28:10,982 --> 00:28:13,974
so that she would
not feel destitute.

460
00:28:14,086 --> 00:28:16,850
It was a kindly thought.

461
00:28:16,955 --> 00:28:21,551
No it was very
good of you.

462
00:28:21,660 --> 00:28:24,185
We were your trustees

463
00:28:24,296 --> 00:28:26,093
that was the way
I looked at it,

464
00:28:26,198 --> 00:28:27,893
although my brother

465
00:28:27,999 --> 00:28:29,660
did not altogether
see it in that light.

466
00:28:29,768 --> 00:28:32,601
We had plenty of
money ourselves.

467
00:28:32,704 --> 00:28:36,435
It would have been
in such bad taste

468
00:28:36,541 --> 00:28:39,339
to have treated
a young lady

469
00:28:39,444 --> 00:28:42,777
in so scurvy a fashion.

470
00:28:44,249 --> 00:28:46,513
Yesterday an event

471
00:28:46,618 --> 00:28:50,213
of extreme
importance occurred.

472
00:28:54,526 --> 00:28:58,690
We, found of
the treasure.

473
00:28:58,797 --> 00:29:03,200
Hence my instant
communication to
you Miss Morstan.

474
00:29:03,301 --> 00:29:06,759
Now all we have to do
is to drive to Norwood

475
00:29:06,872 --> 00:29:09,602
and claim our share.

476
00:29:12,611 --> 00:29:15,341
We shall be expected,

477
00:29:15,447 --> 00:29:19,611
if not entirely
welcome, visitors.

478
00:29:19,718 --> 00:29:23,449
You have done well from
first to last Mr. Sholto.

479
00:29:27,392 --> 00:29:31,089
My health is
somewhat fragile.

480
00:29:31,196 --> 00:29:37,032
I am compelled to
be a valetudinarian.

481
00:29:37,135 --> 00:29:39,330
Please?

482
00:29:50,515 --> 00:29:53,575
We dug up every
inch of the garden

483
00:29:53,685 --> 00:29:57,951
without discovering
anything.

484
00:29:58,056 --> 00:30:01,617
Brother Bartholomew is
such a clever fellow.

485
00:30:01,726 --> 00:30:03,557
Do you know how
he found out

486
00:30:03,662 --> 00:30:05,027
where the treasure was?

487
00:30:05,130 --> 00:30:07,189
Tell me.

488
00:30:07,299 --> 00:30:08,857
He made measurements
everywhere,

489
00:30:08,967 --> 00:30:10,298
all along the top,

490
00:30:10,402 --> 00:30:13,200
along the side, inside
and he found out

491
00:30:13,305 --> 00:30:16,638
he was 4 foot
out at the top.

492
00:30:16,741 --> 00:30:20,700
We found our father
made a false room

493
00:30:20,812 --> 00:30:24,771
So he smashed through
the lath and the plaster

494
00:30:24,883 --> 00:30:27,351
and there was the
treasure chest

495
00:30:27,452 --> 00:30:30,387
lying across the rafters.

496
00:30:30,489 --> 00:30:33,481
He has computed the
value of the treasure

497
00:30:33,592 --> 00:30:37,790
to be more than one
half million sterling.

498
00:30:37,896 --> 00:30:40,592
[scream]

499
00:30:40,699 --> 00:30:42,860
It's Mrs. Bernstone.

500
00:30:42,968 --> 00:30:45,903
Mrs. Bernstone is the
only lady in the house

501
00:30:46,004 --> 00:30:47,733
wait here.

502
00:30:59,050 --> 00:31:03,009
Oh, Mr. Thaddeus I'm
so glad you've come!

503
00:31:03,121 --> 00:31:05,681
I'm so glad
you've come, sir!

504
00:31:09,361 --> 00:31:13,422
What a strange place!

505
00:31:13,532 --> 00:31:15,193
It looks as if all
the moles in England

506
00:31:15,300 --> 00:31:17,495
have been let
loose in it.

507
00:31:19,704 --> 00:31:22,366
There's something
amiss with Bartholomew

508
00:31:22,474 --> 00:31:24,965
Into the house!

509
00:31:38,189 --> 00:31:40,987
bless your
sweet, calm face.

510
00:31:41,092 --> 00:31:44,493
Oh, but I have been
sorely tried this day.

511
00:31:44,596 --> 00:31:46,587
How Mrs. Bernstone?

512
00:31:46,698 --> 00:31:48,893
Mr. Bartholomew shut
himself in his room

513
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:51,264
and I can't get a
word out of him.

514
00:31:51,369 --> 00:31:53,303
His bed hasn't
been slept in

515
00:31:53,405 --> 00:31:56,238
and he hasn't been
down for any food.

516
00:31:56,341 --> 00:31:58,468
I dare not disturb
him at his work.

517
00:31:58,577 --> 00:32:01,307
You know what he's like
when it's his work.

518
00:32:01,413 --> 00:32:03,745
Look after her
Miss Morstan.

519
00:32:09,654 --> 00:32:11,519
There, there do
try to calm down.

520
00:32:11,623 --> 00:32:13,386
Look I'm sure everything
will be all right.

521
00:32:13,491 --> 00:32:15,721
I do hope your right Miss.

522
00:32:15,827 --> 00:32:16,657
Sit down over there.

523
00:32:25,737 --> 00:32:27,102
Come.

524
00:32:38,383 --> 00:32:40,317
Which is the door?

525
00:33:14,185 --> 00:33:16,915
There's something
devilish in this, Watson.

526
00:33:53,625 --> 00:33:56,116
The sign of
the four again.

527
00:33:56,227 --> 00:33:58,024
What in God's name
does it all mean?

528
00:33:58,129 --> 00:34:00,689
It means murder.

529
00:34:04,169 --> 00:34:06,103
We brought the treasure
down there last night.

530
00:34:09,374 --> 00:34:10,841
Now its gone.

531
00:34:10,942 --> 00:34:12,842
What time is that?

532
00:34:12,944 --> 00:34:15,469
I don't know.

533
00:34:15,580 --> 00:34:20,677
I think six, or seven.

534
00:34:20,785 --> 00:34:25,347
I heard him lock the
door after I left.

535
00:34:25,457 --> 00:34:30,827
I must have been the last
person to see him alive.

536
00:34:30,929 --> 00:34:32,920
And now he's dead

537
00:34:37,035 --> 00:34:39,128
you think I did it?

538
00:34:39,237 --> 00:34:41,262
I didn't,
why should I,

539
00:34:41,372 --> 00:34:42,566
I wouldn't have
wanted you...

540
00:34:42,674 --> 00:34:44,335
I wouldn't have
asked you to...

541
00:34:44,442 --> 00:34:45,466
I'll go mad.

542
00:34:45,577 --> 00:34:46,839
Gentle, gently,
gentle Mr. Sholto.

543
00:34:46,945 --> 00:34:48,310
I suggest that
you go down to
the police station

544
00:34:48,413 --> 00:34:50,005
and tell them everything
that you know.

545
00:34:50,115 --> 00:34:52,481
We shall wait here
until you return.

546
00:34:52,584 --> 00:34:55,075
Holmes look at this.

547
00:34:55,186 --> 00:34:56,414
Careful!

548
00:34:56,521 --> 00:34:59,752
Forgive me,
its poisoned.

549
00:34:59,858 --> 00:35:01,849
Well Watson we
have a little time

550
00:35:01,960 --> 00:35:04,554
let's make the
most of it.

551
00:35:04,662 --> 00:35:06,289
Awe this is an
Insoluble mystery to me.

552
00:35:06,397 --> 00:35:07,728
It grows darker
instead of clearer.

553
00:35:07,832 --> 00:35:09,595
No, no, no, no it
clears every instant.

554
00:35:09,701 --> 00:35:10,998
I only require a
few missing links

555
00:35:11,102 --> 00:35:13,764
to have an entirely
connected case.

556
00:35:13,872 --> 00:35:15,271
Simple as the
case seems now

557
00:35:15,373 --> 00:35:18,137
there may be something
deeper underlying it.

558
00:35:18,243 --> 00:35:20,074
How did these
people come

559
00:35:20,178 --> 00:35:21,577
and how did they go?

560
00:35:21,679 --> 00:35:22,839
People?

561
00:35:22,947 --> 00:35:24,505
Well it takes more than
one, perhaps more than 2

562
00:35:24,616 --> 00:35:25,981
to remove a heavy
treasure chest

563
00:35:26,084 --> 00:35:28,018
from a place like this.

564
00:35:28,119 --> 00:35:30,553
The door hasn't been
opened since last night.

565
00:35:30,655 --> 00:35:32,885
So how about
these windows?

566
00:35:38,596 --> 00:35:41,326
Snibbed on the inside.

567
00:35:41,432 --> 00:35:43,525
No hinges.

568
00:35:43,635 --> 00:35:44,693
Roof quite out of reach.

569
00:35:44,803 --> 00:35:47,738
No drainpipe near.

570
00:35:47,839 --> 00:35:49,500
Yet someone has
entered this way look.

571
00:35:49,607 --> 00:35:51,006
Watson.

572
00:35:51,109 --> 00:35:54,169
See that a scuff
on the sill.

573
00:35:59,784 --> 00:36:03,015
Look at this Watson

574
00:36:03,121 --> 00:36:04,782
and this and this.

575
00:36:04,889 --> 00:36:06,516
This is a very
pretty demonstration.

576
00:36:06,624 --> 00:36:08,990
But that's not a footmark.

577
00:36:09,093 --> 00:36:10,560
Something much more
valuable to us.

578
00:36:10,662 --> 00:36:12,857
This is mark of
a boot and this

579
00:36:12,964 --> 00:36:17,833
this the mark of
the timber toe.

580
00:36:17,936 --> 00:36:20,370
It is a
wooden-legged man.

581
00:36:20,471 --> 00:36:22,939
And someone else.

582
00:36:23,041 --> 00:36:26,238
A very able and
efficient ally.

583
00:36:26,344 --> 00:36:28,505
Could you scale
that wall, Watson?

584
00:36:37,021 --> 00:36:38,318
Absolutely impossible.

585
00:36:38,423 --> 00:36:39,651
I aid it is so

586
00:36:39,757 --> 00:36:42,282
but suppose you
had a friend

587
00:36:42,393 --> 00:36:45,726
who lowered you
this good stout rope

588
00:36:45,830 --> 00:36:47,593
securing it first
to this ring.

589
00:36:47,699 --> 00:36:50,429
I think if you
were an active man,

590
00:36:50,535 --> 00:36:52,025
you'd be able
to swarm up,

591
00:36:52,136 --> 00:36:53,899
wooden leg and all.

592
00:36:54,005 --> 00:36:55,472
You would depart,
of course,

593
00:36:55,573 --> 00:36:57,438
in the same fashion,
and then your friend

594
00:36:57,542 --> 00:36:59,203
would pull up the rope,

595
00:37:02,614 --> 00:37:04,206
close the window,

596
00:37:04,315 --> 00:37:05,543
snib it on the inside,

597
00:37:05,650 --> 00:37:08,380
and depart in the manner
he originally came.

598
00:37:11,155 --> 00:37:13,646
Well the thing grows more
unintelligible than ever.

599
00:37:13,758 --> 00:37:16,124
How about this
mysterious ally?

600
00:37:16,227 --> 00:37:17,819
How did he get
into the room?

601
00:37:17,929 --> 00:37:20,454
Yes, this ally.

602
00:37:20,565 --> 00:37:21,930
He lifts this case

603
00:37:22,033 --> 00:37:24,160
from the regions of
the commonplace.

604
00:37:24,269 --> 00:37:28,501
Well the door is locked;
the window inaccessible.

605
00:37:28,606 --> 00:37:29,766
The grate's too small.

606
00:37:29,874 --> 00:37:31,136
How then?

607
00:37:31,242 --> 00:37:32,641
You will not
follow my precept.

608
00:37:32,744 --> 00:37:33,938
How often have
I said to you

609
00:37:34,045 --> 00:37:35,307
that once you have
eliminated the impossible,

610
00:37:35,413 --> 00:37:36,675
whatever remains,

611
00:37:36,781 --> 00:37:38,043
however improbable,

612
00:37:38,149 --> 00:37:40,640
must be the truth?

613
00:37:45,189 --> 00:37:46,747
He must of come in
through the roof.

614
00:37:46,858 --> 00:37:48,450
Excellent Watson,
hold this lamp.

615
00:37:48,559 --> 00:37:51,084
Let us carry our research
to the room above

616
00:37:51,195 --> 00:37:54,995
the secret room in which
the treasure was found.

617
00:37:59,070 --> 00:38:01,538
The skylight.

618
00:38:12,417 --> 00:38:17,616
Holmes a child has
done this horrid thing.

619
00:38:17,722 --> 00:38:19,952
My memory failed me,

620
00:38:20,058 --> 00:38:22,925
for I should have been
able to foretell it.

621
00:38:23,027 --> 00:38:24,688
There is nothing we
can learn from here.

622
00:38:24,796 --> 00:38:25,820
Let us go down.

623
00:38:35,039 --> 00:38:37,166
What is your theory
about those footmarks?

624
00:38:37,275 --> 00:38:39,243
My dear Watson, try a
little analysis yourself.

625
00:38:39,344 --> 00:38:40,436
You know my methods.

626
00:38:40,545 --> 00:38:41,534
Apply them.

627
00:38:41,646 --> 00:38:42,670
I cannot conceive
of anything

628
00:38:42,780 --> 00:38:44,805
that will cover
the facts.

629
00:38:44,916 --> 00:38:46,577
You will soon.

630
00:39:03,968 --> 00:39:06,129
We're in luck.

631
00:39:06,237 --> 00:39:09,172
Our little ally

632
00:39:09,273 --> 00:39:11,571
has trod in
the creosote.

633
00:39:11,676 --> 00:39:14,236
[Voices from afar].

634
00:39:17,648 --> 00:39:20,310
Ahh, look at that.

635
00:39:20,418 --> 00:39:22,443
Quite a nice little
place you got here.

636
00:39:26,257 --> 00:39:27,656
Holmes!

637
00:39:27,759 --> 00:39:29,454
representatives of the law

638
00:39:29,560 --> 00:39:31,255
unless I'm very,
very much mistaken.

639
00:39:31,362 --> 00:39:33,262
Now Watson

640
00:39:33,364 --> 00:39:35,059
before they come

641
00:39:35,166 --> 00:39:37,134
what do you make of
this poor fellow?

642
00:39:37,235 --> 00:39:39,999
The muscles are
stiff as a board.

643
00:39:40,104 --> 00:39:42,334
A state of extreme
contraction,

644
00:39:42,440 --> 00:39:45,000
far exceeding the
usual rigor mortis.

645
00:39:45,109 --> 00:39:46,633
Quite so.

646
00:39:46,744 --> 00:39:48,644
Coupled with this
distortion of the face,

647
00:39:48,746 --> 00:39:50,441
the Hippocratic smile,

648
00:39:50,548 --> 00:39:53,540
risus sardonicus, as the
old writers called it,

649
00:39:53,651 --> 00:39:56,518
what would that
suggest to your mind?

650
00:39:56,621 --> 00:39:59,089
Death from a powerful
vegetable alkaloid

651
00:39:59,190 --> 00:40:00,657
some strychnine-like
substance

652
00:40:00,758 --> 00:40:01,918
that produces tetanus.

653
00:40:04,095 --> 00:40:06,893
Well,

654
00:40:06,998 --> 00:40:08,431
to the right,

655
00:40:08,533 --> 00:40:11,093
come on along
gentleman to the right.

656
00:40:11,202 --> 00:40:13,193
Up these stairs.

657
00:40:17,875 --> 00:40:20,309
This thorn.

658
00:40:20,411 --> 00:40:22,538
old English thorn.

659
00:40:26,984 --> 00:40:28,747
I think it is not right
that Miss Morstan

660
00:40:28,853 --> 00:40:30,912
remain in this
stricken house.

661
00:40:31,022 --> 00:40:32,819
I suggest you slip away
and take her home Watson

662
00:40:32,924 --> 00:40:34,858
and then go to
3 Pinchin Lane,

663
00:40:34,959 --> 00:40:36,517
Lambeth and ask for Toby.

664
00:40:36,627 --> 00:40:37,787
3 Pinchin Lane.

665
00:40:37,895 --> 00:40:39,556
I'd rather have Toby's
help than that of the

666
00:40:39,664 --> 00:40:41,632
whole protective
force London.

667
00:40:45,203 --> 00:40:48,764
Well here's a
pretty business!

668
00:40:51,342 --> 00:40:53,640
Place is as full
as a rabbit-warren!

669
00:40:55,847 --> 00:40:58,338
I think you better
recollect me,

670
00:40:58,449 --> 00:41:02,044
Mr. Athelney Jones.

671
00:41:02,153 --> 00:41:07,455
Why, of course I do!

672
00:41:07,558 --> 00:41:11,255
Mr. Sherlock Holmes,
the theorist.

673
00:41:11,362 --> 00:41:14,126
I'll never forget that
you lectured us all

674
00:41:14,232 --> 00:41:17,133
about the Bishopgate
jewel case.

675
00:41:17,235 --> 00:41:20,796
True you set us on
the right track then

676
00:41:20,905 --> 00:41:22,372
I think you'll own now

677
00:41:22,473 --> 00:41:24,964
it is more by good luck
than good guidance.

678
00:41:25,076 --> 00:41:26,907
It was a piece of
very simple reasoning.

679
00:41:27,011 --> 00:41:28,911
Oh, come, now, come!

680
00:41:29,013 --> 00:41:31,880
Never be ashamed
to own up.

681
00:41:31,983 --> 00:41:37,717
But what is all this?

682
00:41:37,822 --> 00:41:39,084
It's a bad business!

683
00:41:39,190 --> 00:41:42,785
Bad business!

684
00:41:42,894 --> 00:41:46,557
Stern facts here

685
00:41:46,664 --> 00:41:48,598
no room for theories.

686
00:41:48,699 --> 00:41:51,133
It's lucky I happened
to be up at Norwood

687
00:41:51,235 --> 00:41:54,500
on another case when
I got the message.

688
00:41:54,605 --> 00:41:56,470
How do you think
this man died?

689
00:41:56,574 --> 00:41:58,337
This is not a case for
me to theorize over.

690
00:41:58,442 --> 00:42:00,603
No, no, no.

691
00:42:00,711 --> 00:42:02,269
Still, we can't deny

692
00:42:02,380 --> 00:42:05,781
you hit the nail on
the head sometimes.

693
00:42:08,386 --> 00:42:12,152
Door locked,
I understand.

694
00:42:12,256 --> 00:42:15,316
Jewels worth a
fortune missing.

695
00:42:15,426 --> 00:42:16,825
How were the windows?

696
00:42:16,928 --> 00:42:18,555
Fastened; but there was
a footstep on the sill.

697
00:42:18,663 --> 00:42:20,494
Windows fastened.

698
00:42:20,598 --> 00:42:23,897
Nothing to do with
it. It's common sense.

699
00:42:27,572 --> 00:42:31,440
Man could have died
in a fit I suppose.

700
00:42:31,542 --> 00:42:33,237
Ha!

701
00:42:33,344 --> 00:42:35,744
I have a theory.

702
00:42:35,846 --> 00:42:37,973
These flashes come
to me sometimes.

703
00:42:38,082 --> 00:42:40,778
Sergeant, outside
if you please.

704
00:42:40,885 --> 00:42:43,615
And you too, Mr. Sholto.

705
00:42:46,991 --> 00:42:49,425
What do you think
of this, Holmes?

706
00:42:49,527 --> 00:42:51,324
Sholto has confessed

707
00:42:51,429 --> 00:42:53,954
he was with his
brother last night.

708
00:42:54,065 --> 00:42:55,396
The brother died in a fit.

709
00:42:55,499 --> 00:42:56,830
Sholto walks off
with the treasure?

710
00:42:56,934 --> 00:42:58,060
How about that?

711
00:42:58,169 --> 00:42:59,568
Whereupon a dead man
very considerately

712
00:42:59,670 --> 00:43:03,470
gets up and locks the
door from the inside.

713
00:43:03,574 --> 00:43:07,670
Hum!

714
00:43:08,179 --> 00:43:11,740
There's a flaw
there somewhere.

715
00:43:11,849 --> 00:43:16,115
Let us apply common
sense to the matter.

716
00:43:16,220 --> 00:43:17,744
They were brothers

717
00:43:17,855 --> 00:43:20,346
there was a quarrel

718
00:43:20,458 --> 00:43:23,586
brother
Bartholomew dead

719
00:43:23,694 --> 00:43:24,991
jewels gone.

720
00:43:25,096 --> 00:43:27,326
And master Thaddeus

721
00:43:27,431 --> 00:43:30,366
evidently in a
disturbed state of mind.

722
00:43:30,468 --> 00:43:33,835
His appearance well,
not attractive.

723
00:43:33,938 --> 00:43:35,701
You see

724
00:43:35,806 --> 00:43:40,175
I'm weaving a web
around Thaddeus.

725
00:43:40,278 --> 00:43:43,975
The net begins to
close upon him.

726
00:43:44,081 --> 00:43:45,844
Jones

727
00:43:45,950 --> 00:43:48,248
that splinter,

728
00:43:50,621 --> 00:43:53,454
which I firmly believe
to be poisoned,

729
00:43:53,557 --> 00:43:55,787
that card and
that curiously
shaped instrument

730
00:43:55,893 --> 00:43:58,157
were lying there
on the table.

731
00:44:02,033 --> 00:44:04,763
Confirms my theory

732
00:44:04,869 --> 00:44:07,565
in every respect.

733
00:44:07,672 --> 00:44:09,299
The house is full of
Indian curiosities.

734
00:44:09,407 --> 00:44:11,341
All point to Thaddeus.

735
00:44:14,812 --> 00:44:16,677
But

736
00:44:16,781 --> 00:44:18,612
how did he escape?

737
00:44:21,786 --> 00:44:27,281
There is a trapdoor
in the roof Sergeant.

738
00:44:27,391 --> 00:44:31,452
May I ask Mr. Sholto
to step this way?

739
00:44:31,562 --> 00:44:35,828
You see facts are better
than theories, after all.

740
00:44:35,933 --> 00:44:38,026
My view of the
case is confirmed.

741
00:44:38,135 --> 00:44:39,602
There is a trapdoor

742
00:44:39,704 --> 00:44:41,137
communicating
with the roof,

743
00:44:41,238 --> 00:44:44,298
and it is partly open.

744
00:44:44,408 --> 00:44:47,707
It is I who opened it.

745
00:44:47,812 --> 00:44:50,280
Mr. Thaddeus Sholto, it
is my duty to inform you

746
00:44:50,381 --> 00:44:51,814
that anything you say
will be taken down

747
00:44:51,916 --> 00:44:54,180
and maybe used in
evidence against you.

748
00:44:54,285 --> 00:44:55,809
I arrest you in
the Queen's name

749
00:44:55,920 --> 00:44:59,617
as being concerned in the
death of your brother.

750
00:44:59,724 --> 00:45:01,351
I didn't I tell you

751
00:45:01,459 --> 00:45:03,984
Don't trouble
yourself, Mr. Sholto.

752
00:45:04,095 --> 00:45:05,392
I think that I can engage

753
00:45:05,496 --> 00:45:06,963
to clear you
of this charge.

754
00:45:07,064 --> 00:45:09,862
Don't promise too
much, Mr. Theorist.

755
00:45:09,967 --> 00:45:13,164
You may find it a harder
matter than you think.

756
00:45:13,270 --> 00:45:15,204
Not only will I
clear Mr. Sholto,

757
00:45:15,306 --> 00:45:16,830
but I will give
you a description

758
00:45:16,941 --> 00:45:19,375
of the 2 men who were
in this room last night.

759
00:45:19,477 --> 00:45:20,808
One was a poorly
educated man,

760
00:45:20,911 --> 00:45:22,071
strong,

761
00:45:22,179 --> 00:45:23,510
active,

762
00:45:23,614 --> 00:45:24,876
with his right leg off,

763
00:45:24,982 --> 00:45:26,950
wearing a stump worn
away on the inside.

764
00:45:27,051 --> 00:45:30,612
His left boot has a
coarse, square-toed sole

765
00:45:30,721 --> 00:45:33,986
it has an iron band
around the heel.

766
00:45:34,091 --> 00:45:36,082
He's much sunburned,
middle-aged

767
00:45:36,193 --> 00:45:37,888
and has a certain
amount of skin missing

768
00:45:37,995 --> 00:45:40,190
from the palm of one hand.

769
00:45:40,297 --> 00:45:43,198
And the other one?

770
00:45:43,300 --> 00:45:45,825
He's rather a
curious person.

771
00:45:48,038 --> 00:45:49,437
I hope before
long to be able to

772
00:45:49,540 --> 00:45:51,633
introduce you to
the pair of them.

773
00:45:59,383 --> 00:46:02,250
<i>Watson, go to 3
Pinchin Lane, London</i>

774
00:46:02,353 --> 00:46:04,412
<i>and ask for Toby.</i>

775
00:46:04,522 --> 00:46:05,955
<i>I'd rather have
Toby's help</i>

776
00:46:06,056 --> 00:46:08,422
<i>than that of the whole
detective force of London.</i>

777
00:46:45,763 --> 00:46:47,492
Mr. Toby?

778
00:46:51,101 --> 00:46:52,830
Mr. Toby?

779
00:46:52,937 --> 00:46:54,063
Mr. Toby?

780
00:46:54,171 --> 00:46:55,331
Get out of it.

781
00:46:55,439 --> 00:46:56,667
You drunken hooligan.

782
00:46:56,774 --> 00:46:58,503
Go on get out of it or
I'll turn my dogs on you.

783
00:46:58,609 --> 00:47:00,099
All 43 of them.

784
00:47:00,211 --> 00:47:03,180
I'm looking for Mr. Toby.

785
00:47:03,280 --> 00:47:04,542
I have a viper
in this bag,

786
00:47:04,648 --> 00:47:06,013
and I'll tip it
out over your 'ead

787
00:47:06,116 --> 00:47:07,413
if you don't hoof it!

788
00:47:07,518 --> 00:47:09,145
It's urgent
that I find him.

789
00:47:09,253 --> 00:47:10,720
I won't be argued with!

790
00:47:10,821 --> 00:47:13,119
1 , 2, 3 and down
comes the viper.

791
00:47:13,224 --> 00:47:15,055
I've come from Mr. Holmes.

792
00:47:15,159 --> 00:47:17,957
I've come from Mr.
Sherlock Holmes.

793
00:47:24,068 --> 00:47:27,265
Mr. Sherlock Holmes

794
00:47:27,371 --> 00:47:30,932
well who'd of
thought it?

795
00:47:31,041 --> 00:47:32,975
Awe here you are.

796
00:47:35,880 --> 00:47:37,814
Mr. Sherlock Holmes
why didn't you say so,

797
00:47:37,915 --> 00:47:41,476
come in.

798
00:47:41,585 --> 00:47:43,883
[inaudible].

799
00:47:43,988 --> 00:47:46,047
Oh yes he does
now Naughty.

800
00:47:46,156 --> 00:47:48,056
Oh please don't you
bite the gentleman

801
00:47:48,158 --> 00:47:50,092
cause this gentleman
is a friend

802
00:47:50,194 --> 00:47:51,627
of Mr. Sherlock Holmes

803
00:47:51,729 --> 00:47:53,162
and any friend of
Mr. Sherlock Holmes

804
00:47:53,264 --> 00:47:55,198
is a friend of mine.

805
00:47:55,299 --> 00:47:56,095
Don't mind him.

806
00:47:56,200 --> 00:47:58,134
He'll just give you a
nice friendly squeeze.

807
00:47:58,235 --> 00:47:59,566
I've give him the
run of the room

808
00:47:59,670 --> 00:48:03,470
because he keeps
down the beetles
something beautiful.

809
00:48:03,574 --> 00:48:05,064
Now what did you say

810
00:48:05,175 --> 00:48:06,972
Mr. Sherlock
Holmes wanted?

811
00:48:07,077 --> 00:48:08,044
Toby.

812
00:48:08,145 --> 00:48:08,839
Toby?

813
00:48:08,946 --> 00:48:10,004
Yes Toby.

814
00:48:10,114 --> 00:48:11,274
Awe well Toby's No. 7

815
00:48:11,382 --> 00:48:12,508
there along on the left.

816
00:48:12,616 --> 00:48:13,810
Here you give him these

817
00:48:13,918 --> 00:48:14,907
and Toby will go
along with you

818
00:48:15,019 --> 00:48:16,680
as quiet as a lamb.

819
00:48:16,787 --> 00:48:18,311
Hey Toby wake up come on.

820
00:48:18,422 --> 00:48:19,354
There's work
for you to do.

821
00:48:19,456 --> 00:48:22,289
A gentleman's come
here to see you.

822
00:48:22,393 --> 00:48:24,918
Toby come on.

823
00:48:25,029 --> 00:48:26,724
Come on love.

824
00:48:46,450 --> 00:48:50,409
Come on Toby.

825
00:48:54,525 --> 00:48:58,359
Watson?

826
00:48:58,462 --> 00:49:00,657
It's all right officer
it's Mr. Holmes.

827
00:49:01,231 --> 00:49:02,892
Coach around.

828
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:04,695
Come on Toby.

829
00:49:19,917 --> 00:49:22,818
Well done you've got Toby.

830
00:49:26,824 --> 00:49:28,314
Here comes London.

831
00:49:28,425 --> 00:49:30,359
I'm coming down.

832
00:49:51,815 --> 00:49:53,578
Holmes!

833
00:50:07,031 --> 00:50:08,896
Ah,

834
00:50:11,669 --> 00:50:14,229
look at these Watson.

835
00:50:14,338 --> 00:50:16,203
I found them
in the gutter.

836
00:50:16,306 --> 00:50:20,242
Oh thank you
Mrs. Bernstone.

837
00:50:20,344 --> 00:50:22,904
Do you smell the creosote?

838
00:50:23,013 --> 00:50:25,846
Athelney Jones arrested
not only Thaddeus

839
00:50:25,949 --> 00:50:27,678
but also the gatekeeper,

840
00:50:27,785 --> 00:50:29,047
the gamekeeper,

841
00:50:29,153 --> 00:50:30,518
2 Indian servants.

842
00:50:30,621 --> 00:50:32,282
I was lucky to
escape myself.

843
00:50:32,389 --> 00:50:34,857
Watson are you on for
a bit of a trudge?

844
00:50:34,958 --> 00:50:36,892
Of course.

845
00:50:42,132 --> 00:50:44,862
You and Toby game
as they come

846
00:50:44,968 --> 00:50:46,333
when it's a good
holding scent.

847
00:50:46,437 --> 00:50:47,995
Now find him.

848
00:50:48,105 --> 00:50:49,504
Go Toby.

849
00:50:52,810 --> 00:50:54,675
Seek Toby seek.

850
00:51:06,890 --> 00:51:08,881
Steady Watson steady.

851
00:51:21,004 --> 00:51:23,495
Lucky the rain
has stopped.

852
00:51:23,607 --> 00:51:24,938
The scent will
lie on the road

853
00:51:25,042 --> 00:51:26,634
in spite of their start.

854
00:51:30,714 --> 00:51:34,309
Ah, how sweet the
morning air is.

855
00:51:37,688 --> 00:51:39,246
Have you brought
your pistol Watson?

856
00:51:39,356 --> 00:51:40,846
No I have my stick.

857
00:51:40,958 --> 00:51:42,255
In the event were
led to the men

858
00:51:42,359 --> 00:51:43,883
the peg leg I'll
leave to you.

859
00:51:43,994 --> 00:51:46,258
Leave the ally
to me come.

860
00:51:58,375 --> 00:52:00,843
What the deuce is the
matter with the dog?

861
00:52:15,492 --> 00:52:17,756
They took a boat

862
00:52:17,861 --> 00:52:20,227
except they didn't take
a cab or a balloon.

863
00:52:20,330 --> 00:52:23,697
They must have been
met at the waters edge.

864
00:52:28,071 --> 00:52:29,003
Toby!

865
00:52:30,073 --> 00:52:31,040
Toby!

866
00:52:32,509 --> 00:52:33,441
Toby!

867
00:52:44,154 --> 00:52:44,882
Toby!

868
00:52:46,990 --> 00:52:47,888
Toby!

869
00:52:56,200 --> 00:52:58,634
He's lost his character
to infallibility.

870
00:52:58,735 --> 00:52:59,759
No, no, no.

871
00:52:59,870 --> 00:53:01,201
Toby's not to blame.

872
00:53:03,707 --> 00:53:07,199
Those barrels are
filled with creosote.

873
00:53:07,311 --> 00:53:09,211
The scent was divided.

874
00:53:09,313 --> 00:53:11,110
So like good
huntsmen Watson.

875
00:53:11,215 --> 00:53:12,648
We must cast
the dog again

876
00:53:12,749 --> 00:53:14,080
and find the true one.

877
00:53:14,184 --> 00:53:16,846
Toby

878
00:53:16,954 --> 00:53:18,683
Toby

879
00:53:32,836 --> 00:53:34,269
We're out of luck.

880
00:53:34,371 --> 00:53:37,363
They've taken the
boat from here.

881
00:53:37,474 --> 00:53:40,602
These people are
cleverer than I thought.

882
00:53:40,711 --> 00:53:42,941
Now Watson these
people show

883
00:53:43,046 --> 00:53:45,708
preconcerted
management here.

884
00:53:50,020 --> 00:53:53,387
Mordecai Smith.

885
00:53:53,490 --> 00:53:55,355
You come back here and
get your face washed.

886
00:53:55,459 --> 00:53:56,858
Jack?

887
00:53:56,960 --> 00:53:58,018
Oh you youngin'.

888
00:53:58,128 --> 00:53:59,789
I'll get your Dad to
give you a good spankin'

889
00:53:59,897 --> 00:54:02,422
when he gets back.

890
00:54:02,532 --> 00:54:05,023
My what a rosy-cheeked
young rascal!

891
00:54:05,135 --> 00:54:06,762
Is there anything
you'd like Jack?

892
00:54:06,870 --> 00:54:09,031
I'd like a shillin'.

893
00:54:15,712 --> 00:54:17,907
A fine young lad you
got there, Mrs. Smith.

894
00:54:18,015 --> 00:54:20,347
Lor' bless you, sir, he
is that, and forward.

895
00:54:20,450 --> 00:54:22,247
He gets a'most too
much for me to manage,

896
00:54:22,352 --> 00:54:25,150
'specially when my man
is away days at a time.

897
00:54:25,255 --> 00:54:26,552
Awe it's a pity
about that.

898
00:54:26,657 --> 00:54:28,386
I was hoping to hire
a boat from him,

899
00:54:28,492 --> 00:54:29,550
a steam launch.

900
00:54:29,660 --> 00:54:30,888
Why, bless you, sir,

901
00:54:30,994 --> 00:54:32,291
it is in the steam
launch that he has gone.

902
00:54:32,396 --> 00:54:34,421
Aye' didn't like the
bloke who did the hire

903
00:54:34,531 --> 00:54:37,432
not at all, very rough,
with a wooden leg,

904
00:54:37,534 --> 00:54:38,865
come tappin' at our window

905
00:54:38,969 --> 00:54:40,231
in the middle of the night

906
00:54:40,337 --> 00:54:43,135
and away they went
without a word to me.

907
00:54:43,240 --> 00:54:48,234
Now this man with the
wooden leg, was he alone?

908
00:54:48,345 --> 00:54:51,007
Think he might have
had an animal with him.

909
00:54:51,114 --> 00:54:53,480
A dog?

910
00:54:53,583 --> 00:54:54,982
Didn't look like
no dog to me sir.

911
00:54:55,085 --> 00:54:57,849
More like something that
you find at the zoo.

912
00:54:59,356 --> 00:55:00,914
So tell me about
the launch.

913
00:55:01,024 --> 00:55:02,719
It's the old green bird
with the yellow line.

914
00:55:02,826 --> 00:55:03,986
Oh no, no, sir.

915
00:55:04,094 --> 00:55:05,254
The Aurora has just
been fresh painted

916
00:55:05,362 --> 00:55:06,761
black with a gold trim.

917
00:55:06,863 --> 00:55:09,024
Awe yes, with
a white funnel.

918
00:55:09,132 --> 00:55:11,430
No sir black funnel.

919
00:55:11,535 --> 00:55:13,127
Awe yes of course.

920
00:55:13,236 --> 00:55:14,396
Well thank you Mrs. Smith.

921
00:55:14,504 --> 00:55:15,471
Goodbye Jack.

922
00:55:15,572 --> 00:55:16,903
Bye.

923
00:55:24,581 --> 00:55:25,912
The main thing with
people of that sort

924
00:55:26,016 --> 00:55:27,483
is never to let them
think that information

925
00:55:27,584 --> 00:55:29,108
is of the slightest
importance to you.

926
00:55:29,219 --> 00:55:31,153
If you do they
will instantly

927
00:55:31,254 --> 00:55:35,190
shut up like an oyster.

928
00:55:35,292 --> 00:55:36,953
Well our course seems
pretty clear now.

929
00:55:37,060 --> 00:55:39,494
What would you do, then?

930
00:55:39,596 --> 00:55:40,995
Get on the track
of the Aurora.

931
00:55:41,098 --> 00:55:42,759
It would take days
if not months

932
00:55:42,866 --> 00:55:44,094
to search every wharf
and landing place

933
00:55:44,201 --> 00:55:45,793
on the harbor between
here and Greenwich.

934
00:55:45,902 --> 00:55:47,699
What do you propose?

935
00:55:47,804 --> 00:55:50,637
As our query has no
reason to fear that
he's being hunted

936
00:55:50,741 --> 00:55:52,800
I propose first
of all a bath.

937
00:55:52,909 --> 00:55:54,001
And shave.

938
00:55:54,111 --> 00:55:56,545
And then a good meal and
then some hours of sleep.

939
00:55:56,646 --> 00:55:58,409
At the same time

940
00:55:58,515 --> 00:56:00,574
mobilizing the Baker
Street division

941
00:56:00,684 --> 00:56:02,413
of the detective
police force.

942
00:56:05,255 --> 00:56:08,088
In other words
the irregulars.

943
00:56:20,971 --> 00:56:23,371
Awe the energetic Jones
the ubiquitous reporter

944
00:56:23,473 --> 00:56:24,838
fixed up the case
between them.

945
00:56:24,941 --> 00:56:27,000
Watson look at this.

946
00:56:30,313 --> 00:56:31,746
Here.

947
00:56:36,553 --> 00:56:38,544
Mr. Jones' trained and
experienced faculties

948
00:56:38,655 --> 00:56:43,456
were at once directed
towards the detection
of the criminals.

949
00:56:43,560 --> 00:56:45,460
His well-known
technical knowledge

950
00:56:45,562 --> 00:56:48,998
and powers of
minute observation...

951
00:56:49,099 --> 00:56:50,999
well it gets better still

952
00:56:51,101 --> 00:56:53,228
the prompt and
energetic action

953
00:56:53,336 --> 00:56:54,496
of the officers of the law

954
00:56:54,604 --> 00:56:56,128
shows the great
advantage for the

955
00:56:56,239 --> 00:56:59,072
single vigorous
and masterful mind.

956
00:56:59,176 --> 00:57:01,576
Isn't it gorgeous?

957
00:57:01,678 --> 00:57:03,737
We had a close shave of
being arrested ourselves.

958
00:57:03,847 --> 00:57:05,371
I wouldn't answer
for our safety now

959
00:57:05,482 --> 00:57:07,109
if he has another of
his attacks of energy.

960
00:57:16,193 --> 00:57:18,423
Mr Holmes said
nothing of this.

961
00:57:21,264 --> 00:57:23,528
You can't possibly
go in there.

962
00:57:23,633 --> 00:57:25,828
I'm sorry Mr. Holmes

963
00:57:25,936 --> 00:57:27,369
It's all right
Mrs. Hudson,

964
00:57:27,471 --> 00:57:29,132
they are my guests.

965
00:57:33,176 --> 00:57:35,201
Look, hats off.

966
00:57:35,312 --> 00:57:36,779
I've got your message.

967
00:57:36,880 --> 00:57:38,313
I brought 'em on sharp.

968
00:57:38,415 --> 00:57:42,249
3 bob and a tenner
for the tickets.

969
00:57:45,822 --> 00:57:48,290
Now Wiggins, in future

970
00:57:48,391 --> 00:57:50,291
they can report to
you and you to me.

971
00:57:50,393 --> 00:57:52,691
I cannot have the house
invaded in this way.

972
00:57:52,796 --> 00:57:56,391
Oye stop that.

973
00:57:56,500 --> 00:57:57,728
Sorry.

974
00:57:57,834 --> 00:58:03,067
Now I want you to find
the steamboat Aurora.

975
00:58:03,173 --> 00:58:04,435
Aurora.

976
00:58:04,541 --> 00:58:07,567
Owner Mordecai Smith,

977
00:58:07,677 --> 00:58:09,542
black with gold trim.

978
00:58:09,646 --> 00:58:10,943
Richmond to Gravesend

979
00:58:11,047 --> 00:58:12,446
both sides of the river.

980
00:58:12,549 --> 00:58:13,573
Fine sir.

981
00:58:13,683 --> 00:58:15,048
How much?

982
00:58:15,152 --> 00:58:16,847
Old scale of pay

983
00:58:16,953 --> 00:58:19,922
a guinea to the boy
who finds the boat.

984
00:58:20,023 --> 00:58:22,457
Here is a day in advance.

985
00:58:37,574 --> 00:58:39,064
If the launch
is above water

986
00:58:39,176 --> 00:58:41,610
the irregulars
will find her.

987
00:58:41,711 --> 00:58:44,771
They can go everywhere,
see everything.

988
00:58:48,318 --> 00:58:50,047
If our man had
an easy task

989
00:58:50,153 --> 00:58:52,417
just as ours ought to be.

990
00:58:52,522 --> 00:58:53,921
One-legged men
are not so common

991
00:58:54,024 --> 00:58:55,992
and this other man
must be unique.

992
00:58:58,128 --> 00:59:00,858
The aborigines of
the Andaman Islands

993
00:59:00,964 --> 00:59:02,693
may perhaps claim
the distinction

994
00:59:02,799 --> 00:59:06,394
of being the smallest
race upon this earth.

995
00:59:06,503 --> 00:59:08,232
They are a
fierce, morose,

996
00:59:08,338 --> 00:59:09,896
and intractable people,

997
00:59:10,006 --> 00:59:11,439
though capable of forming

998
00:59:11,541 --> 00:59:13,008
the most devoted
friendships

999
00:59:13,109 --> 00:59:15,373
when their confidence
has once been gained.

1000
00:59:15,478 --> 00:59:20,245
They have always
been a terror to
shipwrecked crews,

1001
00:59:20,350 --> 00:59:23,786
braining the
survivors with their
stone-headed clubs

1002
00:59:23,887 --> 00:59:25,946
or shooting them with

1003
00:59:28,959 --> 00:59:32,087
with poisoned arrows.

1004
00:59:32,195 --> 00:59:34,925
These massacres are
usually concluded

1005
00:59:36,700 --> 00:59:38,395
by a cannibal feast.

1006
00:59:43,807 --> 00:59:47,538
Nice, amiable people.

1007
01:00:03,994 --> 01:00:06,189
And what time
would you like for
dinner Mr. Holmes?

1008
01:00:06,296 --> 01:00:08,696
Half past eight the
day after tomorrow.

1009
01:00:20,076 --> 01:00:21,634
You'll wear yourself
out old man.

1010
01:00:21,745 --> 01:00:23,610
I heard you marching
about all night.

1011
01:00:23,713 --> 01:00:25,271
You really must
get some rest.

1012
01:00:25,382 --> 01:00:26,679
I can't sleep.

1013
01:00:26,783 --> 01:00:29,183
This infernal problem
is consuming me.

1014
01:00:29,286 --> 01:00:31,083
No news?

1015
01:00:31,187 --> 01:00:32,017
None.

1016
01:00:32,122 --> 01:00:33,453
None whatsoever.

1017
01:00:33,556 --> 01:00:35,114
The whole river has been
searched from both sides.

1018
01:00:35,225 --> 01:00:36,658
Mrs. Smith has not
heard from her husband,

1019
01:00:36,760 --> 01:00:38,819
it's too much.

1020
01:00:38,928 --> 01:00:40,862
To be balked by
some petty obstacle

1021
01:00:40,964 --> 01:00:42,829
when all else has
been overcome.

1022
01:01:12,462 --> 01:01:14,692
See anything?

1023
01:01:14,798 --> 01:01:16,663
No nothing.

1024
01:01:46,463 --> 01:01:47,760
Shove off.

1025
01:01:47,864 --> 01:01:50,833
Or you'll feel the
back of my hand.

1026
01:02:04,714 --> 01:02:07,239
I'm not going to
tell you again boy.

1027
01:02:41,651 --> 01:02:44,245
A nice little craft.

1028
01:02:44,354 --> 01:02:45,981
Aye, she's a
good boat this.

1029
01:02:46,089 --> 01:02:48,023
We built her right
in this yard.

1030
01:02:48,124 --> 01:02:49,785
Fastest boat on the river.

1031
01:02:49,893 --> 01:02:51,724
What she in for?

1032
01:02:51,828 --> 01:02:53,295
Repairs to her rudder.

1033
01:02:53,396 --> 01:02:54,590
That's the order.

1034
01:02:54,697 --> 01:02:56,494
I can't find anything
amiss with it.

1035
01:02:56,599 --> 01:02:58,123
I want her in the water

1036
01:02:58,234 --> 01:03:00,896
by six o'clock tonight.

1037
01:03:01,004 --> 01:03:03,905
Fully coaled and steam up.

1038
01:03:04,007 --> 01:03:06,635
Right Mr. Smith
she'll be ready.

1039
01:03:06,743 --> 01:03:09,143
Six o'clock sharp, mind,

1040
01:03:09,245 --> 01:03:13,443
for 2 gentlemen that'll
not be kept waiting.

1041
01:03:13,550 --> 01:03:15,381
Right.

1042
01:03:18,555 --> 01:03:20,546
It's this Norwood
case Doctor.

1043
01:03:20,657 --> 01:03:22,852
I have a great deal
to worry and try me.

1044
01:03:22,959 --> 01:03:26,326
And this case is a
very dark one too.

1045
01:03:26,429 --> 01:03:27,418
Thank you.

1046
01:03:27,530 --> 01:03:29,794
I shall be most grateful
for Mr. Holmes' help.

1047
01:03:29,899 --> 01:03:31,196
Your friend is
a wonderful man

1048
01:03:31,301 --> 01:03:32,962
and not to be beat.

1049
01:03:35,004 --> 01:03:36,904
Well you maybe in
for a long wait.

1050
01:03:37,006 --> 01:03:40,339
Nope I don't think so.

1051
01:03:40,443 --> 01:03:42,343
Go to Baker
Street at once.

1052
01:03:42,445 --> 01:03:44,606
If I've not returned,
wait for me.

1053
01:03:44,714 --> 01:03:47,410
I am close on the track
of the Sholto gang.

1054
01:03:47,517 --> 01:03:48,677
Come with us tonight

1055
01:03:48,785 --> 01:03:50,047
if you want to be
in at the kill.

1056
01:03:50,153 --> 01:03:51,177
Good.

1057
01:03:51,287 --> 01:03:54,415
So he's on the
scent again?

1058
01:03:54,524 --> 01:03:57,322
He's been at
fault too has he?

1059
01:03:57,427 --> 01:04:00,760
Even the best of us are
thrown off sometimes.

1060
01:04:06,002 --> 01:04:06,730
Yes?

1061
01:04:06,836 --> 01:04:07,962
Sherlock Holmes?

1062
01:04:08,071 --> 01:04:08,662
What is it?

1063
01:04:08,771 --> 01:04:10,796
Are you Mr.
Sherlock Holmes?

1064
01:04:10,907 --> 01:04:13,432
No but I'm
acting for him.

1065
01:04:13,543 --> 01:04:16,944
I've come about
this right here.

1066
01:04:17,046 --> 01:04:18,013
If you have any
information

1067
01:04:18,114 --> 01:04:19,843
you may give to me.

1068
01:04:19,949 --> 01:04:21,211
There's a reward.

1069
01:04:21,317 --> 01:04:24,115
Is it about the
steam launch, Aurora?

1070
01:04:24,220 --> 01:04:26,085
I'm telling no one but
Mr. Sherlock Holmes.

1071
01:04:26,189 --> 01:04:28,589
No, no; come inside.

1072
01:04:31,361 --> 01:04:33,795
I'm a police officer.

1073
01:04:33,897 --> 01:04:35,489
You look like one.

1074
01:04:35,598 --> 01:04:36,860
No you will be
recompensated

1075
01:04:36,966 --> 01:04:38,024
for your loss of time.

1076
01:04:38,134 --> 01:04:39,226
You will not have
long to wait.

1077
01:04:39,335 --> 01:04:41,530
Sit down.

1078
01:04:41,638 --> 01:04:42,764
Cigar Mr. Jones?

1079
01:04:42,872 --> 01:04:44,863
Oh, thank you for
you very much.

1080
01:04:51,281 --> 01:04:52,839
As I was saying Doctor,

1081
01:04:52,949 --> 01:04:54,143
I consider your friend

1082
01:04:54,250 --> 01:04:57,708
Mr. Sherlock Holmes is
a man not to be beat.

1083
01:04:57,820 --> 01:04:58,980
He would have made

1084
01:04:59,088 --> 01:05:00,578
the most promising
police officer.

1085
01:05:00,690 --> 01:05:01,884
I don't care
who knows it.

1086
01:05:01,991 --> 01:05:04,551
With a little
more discipline

1087
01:05:04,661 --> 01:05:07,095
and a lot less theory.

1088
01:05:07,196 --> 01:05:08,322
Thank you.

1089
01:05:08,431 --> 01:05:09,989
You might offer me one.

1090
01:05:14,170 --> 01:05:17,571
Oh, you rogue

1091
01:05:17,674 --> 01:05:19,437
you would have
made an actor

1092
01:05:19,542 --> 01:05:21,009
and a rare one.

1093
01:05:21,110 --> 01:05:23,772
You had the proper
workhouse cough,

1094
01:05:23,880 --> 01:05:25,404
and those weak
legs of yours

1095
01:05:25,515 --> 01:05:26,948
there worth 1 0
pounds each.

1096
01:05:27,050 --> 01:05:29,211
A police officer,
I'm flattered.

1097
01:05:29,319 --> 01:05:31,617
Jones I shall need
a police launch

1098
01:05:31,721 --> 01:05:33,154
at the Westminster steps.

1099
01:05:33,256 --> 01:05:34,518
The fastest you have.

1100
01:05:34,624 --> 01:05:36,091
2 stout men,
yourself, myself,

1101
01:05:36,192 --> 01:05:37,955
Watson all of us armed.

1102
01:05:38,061 --> 01:05:39,426
That is easily arranged.

1103
01:05:39,529 --> 01:05:41,292
I will telephone
the local station.

1104
01:05:50,840 --> 01:05:52,364
When we get to the tower

1105
01:05:52,475 --> 01:05:55,501
we'll stop opposite
of Jacobson's Yard.

1106
01:06:06,322 --> 01:06:07,983
How did you find
the Aurora then?

1107
01:06:08,091 --> 01:06:09,991
Well I have reasons that
the launch couldn't be

1108
01:06:10,093 --> 01:06:11,685
far often despite
of its invisibility.

1109
01:06:11,794 --> 01:06:15,059
So gentlemen,
where could it be?

1110
01:06:15,164 --> 01:06:17,394
Well out of the
water I suppose.

1111
01:06:17,500 --> 01:06:19,058
In a repair or
boat builders yard.

1112
01:06:19,168 --> 01:06:21,363
Exactly.

1113
01:06:41,791 --> 01:06:43,588
One of my boys is
waiting by the yard

1114
01:06:43,693 --> 01:06:45,388
to give us the signal.

1115
01:06:45,495 --> 01:06:47,156
You planned it all
very neatly Mr. Holmes

1116
01:06:47,263 --> 01:06:49,390
but if the affair
were in my hands

1117
01:06:49,499 --> 01:06:51,524
I should have a body
of police in the yard

1118
01:06:51,634 --> 01:06:53,363
and arrested them
when they came down.

1119
01:06:53,469 --> 01:06:55,096
Which would
have been never.

1120
01:06:55,204 --> 01:06:58,662
This man Small is a
pretty shrewd fellow.

1121
01:06:58,775 --> 01:07:00,037
Anything suspicious

1122
01:07:00,143 --> 01:07:02,703
and he would lie snug
for another week.

1123
01:07:04,213 --> 01:07:05,510
Sir?

1124
01:07:05,615 --> 01:07:07,139
We're opposite
Jacobson's Yard now,

1125
01:07:07,250 --> 01:07:08,740
shall we move
downstream a little.

1126
01:07:08,851 --> 01:07:12,719
No this mist may be
of an advantage to us.

1127
01:07:12,822 --> 01:07:15,313
We must lie low and wait.

1128
01:07:42,351 --> 01:07:43,648
Your boy's signaling,

1129
01:07:43,753 --> 01:07:45,914
I can see it plainly.

1130
01:08:02,605 --> 01:08:03,970
There's the Aurora

1131
01:08:04,073 --> 01:08:06,268
going like the devil

1132
01:08:06,375 --> 01:08:07,706
She's very fast.

1133
01:08:07,810 --> 01:08:09,243
I doubt if we
shall catch her.

1134
01:08:09,345 --> 01:08:10,812
We must catch her!

1135
01:08:10,913 --> 01:08:13,177
Pile it on, stokers!

1136
01:08:13,282 --> 01:08:14,408
I'll never forgive myself

1137
01:08:14,517 --> 01:08:16,644
if she proves to
have some use.

1138
01:08:22,158 --> 01:08:24,353
Faster, faster.

1139
01:08:24,460 --> 01:08:26,621
This is the fast
boat they've got.

1140
01:08:52,722 --> 01:08:53,814
Pile on the coals.

1141
01:08:53,923 --> 01:08:55,720
Stoke her.

1142
01:08:55,825 --> 01:08:57,417
We must have her.

1143
01:08:57,527 --> 01:08:59,552
Even if we burn the boat.

1144
01:09:30,760 --> 01:09:32,227
Keep the light steady.

1145
01:09:32,328 --> 01:09:34,421
I can almost make
out his companion.

1146
01:10:23,646 --> 01:10:25,204
We're gaining.

1147
01:10:39,996 --> 01:10:41,258
Pile it on, stoker.

1148
01:10:41,364 --> 01:10:44,925
Give it all the
steam we've got.

1149
01:10:45,034 --> 01:10:48,094
I think we
gained a little.

1150
01:10:48,204 --> 01:10:49,569
I'm sure of it.

1151
01:10:49,672 --> 01:10:50,934
Absolutely.

1152
01:11:02,985 --> 01:11:05,112
Point the light
more to the left.

1153
01:11:13,162 --> 01:11:14,493
Keep it steady.

1154
01:11:52,168 --> 01:11:57,196
What's happening
on that boat?

1155
01:11:57,306 --> 01:11:58,739
They're fighting
among themselves.

1156
01:11:58,841 --> 01:12:00,001
Tonga,

1157
01:12:00,109 --> 01:12:01,269
Tonga.

1158
01:12:05,948 --> 01:12:07,472
The peg leg.

1159
01:12:07,583 --> 01:12:09,050
Stop!

1160
01:12:09,151 --> 01:12:10,812
Police!

1161
01:12:10,920 --> 01:12:12,444
Cease you.

1162
01:12:12,555 --> 01:12:15,649
You can burn in hell

1163
01:12:15,758 --> 01:12:18,226
Stop!

1164
01:12:18,327 --> 01:12:23,390
The sign of four

1165
01:12:23,499 --> 01:12:25,660
Watson look.

1166
01:12:40,349 --> 01:12:42,510
What a face.

1167
01:14:49,545 --> 01:14:52,309
Wait

1168
01:14:52,414 --> 01:14:54,279
Wait.

1169
01:14:54,383 --> 01:14:56,817
Let him wear
himself out.

1170
01:15:36,992 --> 01:15:42,396
So Jonathan Small.

1171
01:15:42,498 --> 01:15:45,126
I am sorry it's
come to this.

1172
01:15:45,234 --> 01:15:48,465
And so am I sir.

1173
01:15:48,571 --> 01:15:51,005
But I give you my
word gentlemen

1174
01:15:51,106 --> 01:15:53,597
I never laid hands
on young Mr. Sholto.

1175
01:15:53,709 --> 01:15:55,176
Of course you didn't.

1176
01:15:55,277 --> 01:15:56,744
Your little friends
dart killed him

1177
01:15:56,845 --> 01:15:59,211
while he was still
climbing the rope.

1178
01:16:06,488 --> 01:16:09,355
Well you speak as if
you were there sir.

1179
01:16:19,735 --> 01:16:24,195
Well if it had been
old Major Sholto

1180
01:16:24,306 --> 01:16:28,766
I would have swung for
him with a light heart.

1181
01:16:28,877 --> 01:16:34,076
But to be lagged over
this young Sholto,

1182
01:16:34,183 --> 01:16:36,481
cursed heart.

1183
01:16:36,585 --> 01:16:38,052
You must make a
clean breast of it

1184
01:16:38,153 --> 01:16:41,213
if you do I may
be of use to you.

1185
01:16:43,192 --> 01:16:46,355
Quite a family party.

1186
01:16:46,462 --> 01:16:51,798
I reckon I'll pull
that flask myself.

1187
01:16:51,900 --> 01:16:56,428
Now, where are
you going Small?

1188
01:16:56,538 --> 01:16:59,200
The Esmeralda,
at Gravesend,

1189
01:16:59,308 --> 01:17:01,208
outward bound
for the Brazils.

1190
01:17:01,310 --> 01:17:02,777
And nearly made it.

1191
01:17:02,878 --> 01:17:04,277
Another man at the engines

1192
01:17:04,380 --> 01:17:07,907
and you'd never
have caught us.

1193
01:17:08,017 --> 01:17:11,612
Where's the key my man?

1194
01:17:11,720 --> 01:17:15,713
At the bottom
of the river.

1195
01:17:15,824 --> 01:17:17,223
Now look here,

1196
01:17:17,326 --> 01:17:19,157
we've had enough of
you tonight Small.

1197
01:17:19,261 --> 01:17:21,286
Bring the cuffs in
men, I'm warning you.

1198
01:17:21,397 --> 01:17:23,024
Its alright constable

1199
01:17:23,132 --> 01:17:24,963
When we leave the stacks.

1200
01:17:25,067 --> 01:17:27,228
I suggest that we go
back to Baker Street.

1201
01:17:27,336 --> 01:17:30,032
Well I think Miss
Morstan should be there.

1202
01:17:30,139 --> 01:17:33,006
Well that's not the
regulation way Mr. Holmes.

1203
01:17:33,108 --> 01:17:35,576
Well I can at least
promise you a nice,

1204
01:17:35,678 --> 01:17:38,476
warming drink.

1205
01:17:40,482 --> 01:17:42,211
Very well gentlemen.

1206
01:17:47,690 --> 01:17:50,750
Well Miss Morstan

1207
01:17:50,859 --> 01:17:52,759
I am pleased and proud

1208
01:17:52,861 --> 01:17:56,922
to have been able to bring
the thief to justice.

1209
01:17:57,032 --> 01:17:59,466
Justice?

1210
01:17:59,568 --> 01:18:02,196
The pretty justice.

1211
01:18:02,304 --> 01:18:05,034
Who's loot is this
if it is not ours?

1212
01:18:05,140 --> 01:18:07,574
Where is the justice
that I should give it up

1213
01:18:07,676 --> 01:18:09,439
to those who have
never owned it?

1214
01:18:09,545 --> 01:18:10,569
You forget Small

1215
01:18:10,679 --> 01:18:13,273
they know nothing
of this matter.

1216
01:18:13,382 --> 01:18:15,179
We cannot tell
how far justice

1217
01:18:15,284 --> 01:18:19,584
may have originally
been on your side.

1218
01:18:23,859 --> 01:18:26,487
No sir.

1219
01:18:26,595 --> 01:18:30,395
You have been
fair spoken to me,

1220
01:18:30,499 --> 01:18:32,091
though I can say
that it's you

1221
01:18:32,201 --> 01:18:33,930
that I have to thank

1222
01:18:34,036 --> 01:18:40,134
for these
bracelets on my wrists.

1223
01:18:40,242 --> 01:18:43,734
Still I bear no
grudge for that.

1224
01:18:43,846 --> 01:18:45,370
If you want to
hear my story

1225
01:18:45,481 --> 01:18:47,915
I have no wish
to hold it back.

1226
01:18:48,016 --> 01:18:51,543
And what I say to
you is God's truth,

1227
01:18:51,653 --> 01:18:53,678
every word of it.

1228
01:19:11,640 --> 01:19:13,801
When I was a lad

1229
01:19:13,909 --> 01:19:16,309
I took the Queen's
shilling and was

1230
01:19:16,412 --> 01:19:19,006
posted out to India
with the Third Buff's.

1231
01:19:23,485 --> 01:19:25,578
A crocodile
snapped this off

1232
01:19:25,687 --> 01:19:32,217
when I was bathing
in the Ganges.

1233
01:19:32,327 --> 01:19:33,988
The sawbones
had my stump

1234
01:19:34,096 --> 01:19:37,156
in the tar barrel
nice and quick.

1235
01:19:37,266 --> 01:19:41,202
I was young and strong.

1236
01:19:41,303 --> 01:19:44,602
We got my discharge
and this fellow...

1237
01:19:50,379 --> 01:19:53,371
it's been a good
support to me

1238
01:19:55,918 --> 01:19:59,649
so there I was a
cripple at 20.

1239
01:19:59,755 --> 01:20:02,223
But I liked it out there

1240
01:20:02,324 --> 01:20:04,622
so I found myself a
job as an overseer

1241
01:20:04,726 --> 01:20:07,092
on an Indigo farm.

1242
01:20:07,196 --> 01:20:12,065
I was on horseback all
day so that was fine.

1243
01:20:12,167 --> 01:20:15,295
But I was never
in luck for long,

1244
01:20:15,404 --> 01:20:16,837
without a note of warning

1245
01:20:16,939 --> 01:20:19,601
the great
mutiny was on us.

1246
01:20:19,708 --> 01:20:21,699
I came back to the farm
one evening to find

1247
01:20:21,810 --> 01:20:25,712
my master and all his
family be murdered.

1248
01:20:25,814 --> 01:20:27,213
I didn't wait.

1249
01:20:27,316 --> 01:20:30,410
On that same evening I
was in the Fort of Agra,

1250
01:20:30,519 --> 01:20:33,852
the nearest city still
held by the British.

1251
01:20:33,956 --> 01:20:36,288
The old Fort of Agra,

1252
01:20:36,391 --> 01:20:38,382
a queer place,

1253
01:20:38,494 --> 01:20:40,724
huge,

1254
01:20:40,829 --> 01:20:45,459
it's full of
passages and rooms

1255
01:20:45,567 --> 01:20:49,697
and more entrances
than you can count.

1256
01:20:49,805 --> 01:20:51,295
There were many gates

1257
01:20:51,406 --> 01:20:53,374
and because I was an
ex-soldier and British

1258
01:20:53,475 --> 01:20:55,170
they put me in charge
of one of them

1259
01:20:55,277 --> 01:20:57,108
and gave me a
couple of Sikkhs

1260
01:20:57,212 --> 01:20:58,907
who'd stayed loyal to us.

1261
01:20:59,014 --> 01:21:01,608
It was a lonely place.

1262
01:21:01,717 --> 01:21:05,778
My 2 Punjabis were
experienced, fighting men.

1263
01:21:05,888 --> 01:21:10,052
Kartar Singh and
Indarjit Singh.

1264
01:21:20,903 --> 01:21:22,268
Rebels?

1265
01:21:22,371 --> 01:21:23,895
No rebels.

1266
01:21:24,006 --> 01:21:25,871
The fort is safe.

1267
01:21:25,974 --> 01:21:29,933
There are no rebel
this side of the river.

1268
01:21:30,045 --> 01:21:31,637
You must be with us

1269
01:21:31,747 --> 01:21:34,580
or you must be
silenced forever.

1270
01:21:34,683 --> 01:21:36,344
With you how?

1271
01:21:36,451 --> 01:21:38,544
We want you to be rich,

1272
01:21:38,654 --> 01:21:42,818
which is why you British
came to this land.

1273
01:21:42,925 --> 01:21:45,291
Well I have no
objection of being rich.

1274
01:21:45,394 --> 01:21:48,488
Then swear by the
bones of your father

1275
01:21:48,597 --> 01:21:50,087
to raise no hand

1276
01:21:50,198 --> 01:21:52,530
and to speak no
word against us now

1277
01:21:52,634 --> 01:21:54,761
or ever afterwards

1278
01:21:54,870 --> 01:22:00,001
then you will have
quarter of the treasure.

1279
01:22:00,108 --> 01:22:01,837
But there are
only 3 of us.

1280
01:22:01,944 --> 01:22:04,344
Jagodish Singh my
foster brother

1281
01:22:04,446 --> 01:22:07,813
he must have his share.

1282
01:22:07,916 --> 01:22:13,513
There is no time
Sahib decide.

1283
01:22:13,622 --> 01:22:14,816
Well

1284
01:22:14,923 --> 01:22:18,120
provided the fort is
in no kind of danger

1285
01:22:18,226 --> 01:22:21,684
I swear.

1286
01:22:21,797 --> 01:22:25,494
What would you have
done Mr. Holmes?

1287
01:22:25,601 --> 01:22:26,727
I strongly suspect

1288
01:22:26,835 --> 01:22:30,464
I would have done
exactly as you did.

1289
01:22:30,572 --> 01:22:32,836
Yes I know the Sikkh.

1290
01:22:32,941 --> 01:22:35,375
He's not a man to
be trifled with.

1291
01:22:38,480 --> 01:22:41,040
One of our local Rajahs,

1292
01:22:41,149 --> 01:22:42,446
Rich as Croesus of course,

1293
01:22:42,551 --> 01:22:44,485
he'd gone in
with the rebels.

1294
01:22:44,586 --> 01:22:48,488
But... He wanted
to hedge his bet

1295
01:22:48,590 --> 01:22:51,753
just in case the
British came out on top.

1296
01:22:51,860 --> 01:22:54,385
So he made a plot to
get half his treasure

1297
01:22:54,496 --> 01:22:57,761
hidden in the Fort of Agra

1298
01:22:57,866 --> 01:22:59,390
sending one of
his men with it

1299
01:22:59,501 --> 01:23:01,628
in the guise
of a merchant

1300
01:23:01,737 --> 01:23:03,796
and Jagodish Singh

1301
01:23:03,905 --> 01:23:05,497
Kartar's brother

1302
01:23:05,607 --> 01:23:07,302
to be the guide.

1303
01:23:07,409 --> 01:23:10,037
They come challenging
sahib, in a major way

1304
01:23:10,145 --> 01:23:12,045
giving no caution to fear.

1305
01:23:12,147 --> 01:23:13,114
What then?

1306
01:23:13,215 --> 01:23:14,944
we do what has
to be done.

1307
01:23:26,962 --> 01:23:28,793
Who goes there?

1308
01:23:28,897 --> 01:23:31,422
A friend sahib.

1309
01:23:31,533 --> 01:23:33,865
A friend advance
and be recognized.

1310
01:23:37,606 --> 01:23:39,437
What have you with you?

1311
01:23:39,541 --> 01:23:44,808
A box sahib, old box.

1312
01:23:44,913 --> 01:23:47,074
Having some family papers.

1313
01:23:47,182 --> 01:23:51,209
No good to nobody
sahib only for myself.

1314
01:23:59,795 --> 01:24:04,664
Sahib, I'm no
ordinary beggar.

1315
01:24:04,766 --> 01:24:06,597
You will have money sahib.

1316
01:24:06,702 --> 01:24:09,500
and you comrades
sahib also.

1317
01:24:13,842 --> 01:24:16,402
Take him to the
main guardroom.

1318
01:24:39,634 --> 01:24:43,593
Never was a man
more compassed
round with death.

1319
01:25:16,171 --> 01:25:17,399
If that man had escaped

1320
01:25:17,506 --> 01:25:18,996
the whole affair
would have come out.

1321
01:25:19,107 --> 01:25:23,043
I should have been
shot most like.

1322
01:25:23,145 --> 01:25:29,015
Which of you would have
held back his musket?

1323
01:25:29,117 --> 01:25:32,644
Kartar was for
burning him,

1324
01:25:32,754 --> 01:25:34,551
that's there religion.

1325
01:25:34,656 --> 01:25:37,181
But such a fire
was impossible.

1326
01:25:37,292 --> 01:25:39,260
Jagodish was for
throwing him down

1327
01:25:39,361 --> 01:25:41,056
into the great ditch
below the fort

1328
01:25:41,163 --> 01:25:43,393
where the jackal's
to clean him.

1329
01:25:43,498 --> 01:25:45,864
No doubt he was right.

1330
01:25:45,967 --> 01:25:49,960
I'm always for showing
some respect for the dead.

1331
01:25:50,071 --> 01:25:53,802
Then we turned
to the box,

1332
01:25:53,909 --> 01:25:55,809
this box.

1333
01:25:59,548 --> 01:26:01,277
Inside were more gems

1334
01:26:01,383 --> 01:26:04,443
than I could have ever
even had dreamed of.

1335
01:26:10,959 --> 01:26:14,292
A 1 43 diamonds of
the first order

1336
01:26:14,396 --> 01:26:16,660
including the Great Mogul,

1337
01:26:16,765 --> 01:26:19,928
the second largest
stone in existence.

1338
01:26:20,035 --> 01:26:22,128
97 emeralds,

1339
01:26:22,237 --> 01:26:25,104
1 70 rubies,

1340
01:26:25,207 --> 01:26:26,799
40 carbuncles,

1341
01:26:26,908 --> 01:26:29,342
61 agates.

1342
01:26:33,715 --> 01:26:35,979
Jagodish was right,

1343
01:26:36,084 --> 01:26:38,245
it was a great
mistake you made

1344
01:26:38,353 --> 01:26:41,186
burying the
body as you did

1345
01:26:41,289 --> 01:26:43,985
would you not
say so Watson?

1346
01:26:44,092 --> 01:26:45,491
Yes indeed.

1347
01:26:45,594 --> 01:26:47,186
Bodies not burned in India

1348
01:26:47,295 --> 01:26:48,922
are soon discovered.

1349
01:26:49,030 --> 01:26:50,497
So you and your
3 companions

1350
01:26:50,599 --> 01:26:53,591
were found guilty and
sent away for life

1351
01:26:53,702 --> 01:26:56,637
to the penal colony in
the Andaman Islands.

1352
01:26:56,738 --> 01:26:59,366
Blair Island sir.

1353
01:26:59,474 --> 01:27:01,840
Hopetown,

1354
01:27:01,943 --> 01:27:04,571
never was a place
worse named.

1355
01:27:18,360 --> 01:27:20,885
It was a place to sweat.

1356
01:27:20,996 --> 01:27:23,226
A place to rot.

1357
01:27:23,331 --> 01:27:25,697
A place to die.

1358
01:27:25,800 --> 01:27:29,167
And I sweated there
year after year

1359
01:27:29,271 --> 01:27:32,934
until your father
arrived Miss. Morstan.

1360
01:27:33,041 --> 01:27:35,202
corporal!

1361
01:27:35,310 --> 01:27:38,905
you will not
maltreat the
white prisoner.

1362
01:27:39,014 --> 01:27:40,413
If it happens again

1363
01:27:40,515 --> 01:27:42,415
you'll be court marshaled.

1364
01:27:45,754 --> 01:27:48,188
He was our administrative
officer and he gave me

1365
01:27:48,290 --> 01:27:51,726
a nice cushy villa
in the dispensary.

1366
01:27:51,826 --> 01:27:54,158
He was as good and kind
a Christian gentleman

1367
01:27:54,262 --> 01:27:56,730
as I ever come across

1368
01:27:56,831 --> 01:28:00,824
and I hold no
grudge against him.

1369
01:28:00,936 --> 01:28:02,767
Or you Miss.

1370
01:28:13,415 --> 01:28:16,384
Thank you Mr. Small.

1371
01:28:25,994 --> 01:28:28,929
Well as I sat thinking
about the treasure

1372
01:28:29,030 --> 01:28:31,590
I could see all the
offices and the
prison officials

1373
01:28:31,700 --> 01:28:36,399
at their drinking
and their gambling.

1374
01:28:36,504 --> 01:28:39,496
Major Sholto never
had much luck.

1375
01:28:39,607 --> 01:28:43,805
Night after night
he was the loser.

1376
01:28:43,912 --> 01:28:46,847
Some people are
born like that.

1377
01:28:46,948 --> 01:28:48,472
It's all over
for me Morstan.

1378
01:28:48,583 --> 01:28:50,414
I'm ruined.

1379
01:28:50,518 --> 01:28:54,079
I shall have to
send in my paper.

1380
01:28:54,189 --> 01:28:56,316
I don't suppose
you could manage

1381
01:28:56,424 --> 01:28:58,483
another couple
of hundred hey?

1382
01:28:58,593 --> 01:29:01,619
I had a pretty nasty
face in myself

1383
01:29:01,730 --> 01:29:03,925
and I have a daughter
back home to support.

1384
01:29:04,032 --> 01:29:08,696
Well I've got 2
wretched sons.

1385
01:29:08,803 --> 01:29:12,569
Ruined hey, damn pity.

1386
01:29:12,674 --> 01:29:16,474
So you decided to
approach your benefactor

1387
01:29:16,578 --> 01:29:18,478
Captain Morstan?

1388
01:29:18,580 --> 01:29:20,514
He was often in
the dispensary.

1389
01:29:20,615 --> 01:29:23,379
The tropical climate
didn't agree with him.

1390
01:29:23,485 --> 01:29:24,679
His heart was weak

1391
01:29:24,786 --> 01:29:26,583
and his blood was
all poisoned.

1392
01:29:26,688 --> 01:29:28,212
Knowing that he
would wish to share

1393
01:29:28,323 --> 01:29:29,790
any arrangement
with his friend

1394
01:29:29,891 --> 01:29:32,018
the officer in
command, Major Sholto?

1395
01:29:32,127 --> 01:29:34,561
Yes sir it seemed
the safest way.

1396
01:29:34,662 --> 01:29:36,960
And is there any private
concern over which

1397
01:29:37,065 --> 01:29:39,124
of course you have the
power of disposing

1398
01:29:39,234 --> 01:29:43,762
as you think best

1399
01:29:43,872 --> 01:29:45,499
Thank you for
that advice sir.

1400
01:29:45,607 --> 01:29:47,507
Thank you indeed

1401
01:29:47,609 --> 01:29:48,837
but the fact is

1402
01:29:48,943 --> 01:29:51,377
being in the
position I am

1403
01:29:51,479 --> 01:29:53,504
I need help.

1404
01:29:53,615 --> 01:29:56,311
What sort of help?

1405
01:29:56,418 --> 01:29:59,615
I need a partner.

1406
01:29:59,721 --> 01:30:01,621
Well I'm sure Major
Sholto and myself

1407
01:30:01,723 --> 01:30:04,715
would like to help
you if we could.

1408
01:30:04,826 --> 01:30:07,158
We could at
least talk about,

1409
01:30:07,262 --> 01:30:12,063
that is of course if we
can agree as to terms.

1410
01:30:12,167 --> 01:30:13,464
There's only one bargain

1411
01:30:13,568 --> 01:30:16,503
a man in my
position can make.

1412
01:30:16,604 --> 01:30:18,071
In exchange
for my freedom

1413
01:30:18,173 --> 01:30:20,300
and that of my
3 companions

1414
01:30:20,408 --> 01:30:22,205
we shall give
you a fifth share

1415
01:30:22,310 --> 01:30:23,709
to divide between you.

1416
01:30:23,812 --> 01:30:25,541
A fifth?

1417
01:30:25,647 --> 01:30:27,137
That isn't very much.

1418
01:30:27,248 --> 01:30:30,445
50 thousand
at the least.

1419
01:30:30,552 --> 01:30:31,951
Anyway how can
we possibly

1420
01:30:32,053 --> 01:30:33,384
give you your freedom?

1421
01:30:33,488 --> 01:30:34,853
You know it's impossible.

1422
01:30:34,956 --> 01:30:37,948
All we need is a
boat and provisions.

1423
01:30:38,059 --> 01:30:39,959
There are plenty little
yachts and yawls

1424
01:30:40,061 --> 01:30:42,529
in Calcutta or Madras,

1425
01:30:42,630 --> 01:30:45,428
Well enough to
serve our purpose.

1426
01:30:45,533 --> 01:30:46,966
If only there were
just one of you.

1427
01:30:47,068 --> 01:30:48,467
None.

1428
01:30:48,570 --> 01:30:50,595
None or all.

1429
01:30:50,705 --> 01:30:52,400
We have sworn it.

1430
01:30:52,507 --> 01:30:56,637
The 4 of us must
always act together!

1431
01:30:58,012 --> 01:30:59,001
Calm yourself Sholto.

1432
01:30:59,114 --> 01:31:00,638
Calm yourself,

1433
01:31:00,748 --> 01:31:02,079
think about it man,

1434
01:31:02,183 --> 01:31:03,844
think about it.

1435
01:31:03,952 --> 01:31:06,216
Small is a man
of his word

1436
01:31:06,321 --> 01:31:09,688
he will not abandon
his friends.

1437
01:31:09,791 --> 01:31:14,285
I think we may very
well trust him.

1438
01:31:17,565 --> 01:31:20,033
We met the next morning
in the small hours.

1439
01:31:20,135 --> 01:31:24,970
I had our written
agreement in every detail.

1440
01:31:25,073 --> 01:31:26,904
We being officers
in the Army

1441
01:31:27,008 --> 01:31:28,999
of her majesty
Queen Victoria...

1442
01:31:29,110 --> 01:31:31,010
We being officers
in the Army

1443
01:31:31,112 --> 01:31:32,909
of her majesty
Queen Victoria...

1444
01:31:33,014 --> 01:31:34,948
Do swear on
the Holy Bible

1445
01:31:35,049 --> 01:31:36,914
that this agreement
will always remain

1446
01:31:37,018 --> 01:31:38,986
sacred and
binding to us.

1447
01:31:39,087 --> 01:31:40,850
Do swear on
the Holy Bible

1448
01:31:40,955 --> 01:31:42,946
that this agreement
will always remain

1449
01:31:43,057 --> 01:31:45,787
sacred and binding to us.

1450
01:31:45,894 --> 01:31:47,088
I gave each of
them a plan

1451
01:31:47,195 --> 01:31:49,561
showing the position
of the treasure.

1452
01:31:56,771 --> 01:32:00,366
Oh that brings
back memories.

1453
01:32:00,475 --> 01:32:02,705
Sholto took the
next boat to India,

1454
01:32:02,810 --> 01:32:04,243
found the treasure

1455
01:32:04,345 --> 01:32:05,903
and took it back
with him to England?

1456
01:32:06,014 --> 01:32:07,538
Yes.

1457
01:32:07,649 --> 01:32:09,344
When we heard the news

1458
01:32:09,450 --> 01:32:12,385
Captain Morstan was
as angry as I was.

1459
01:32:12,487 --> 01:32:14,011
He swore to me
he would go home

1460
01:32:14,122 --> 01:32:16,420
and settle the
matter with Sholto.

1461
01:32:26,501 --> 01:32:30,096
And so he would
if he lived

1462
01:32:30,205 --> 01:32:32,435
but that was not to be.

1463
01:32:40,748 --> 01:32:42,238
From that day,

1464
01:32:42,350 --> 01:32:45,251
I lived only
for vengeance.

1465
01:32:48,156 --> 01:32:50,317
I thought of it by day,

1466
01:32:51,926 --> 01:32:54,190
I nursed it by night

1467
01:32:54,295 --> 01:32:56,627
to get to Sholto,

1468
01:32:56,731 --> 01:32:59,063
put my hands
on his throat

1469
01:32:59,167 --> 01:33:02,000
that was my one thought.

1470
01:33:02,103 --> 01:33:03,866
As luck would have it,

1471
01:33:03,972 --> 01:33:05,234
one of the islanders

1472
01:33:05,340 --> 01:33:07,035
had been brought in
to my dispensary,

1473
01:33:07,141 --> 01:33:09,666
more than half dead
from a snakebite.

1474
01:33:09,777 --> 01:33:12,871
And in common humanity
I did my best for him.

1475
01:33:12,981 --> 01:33:14,414
Somehow he pulled through

1476
01:33:14,515 --> 01:33:18,952
and became very
devoted to me,

1477
01:33:19,053 --> 01:33:22,989
a funny little fellow.

1478
01:33:23,091 --> 01:33:25,184
Well you gentlemen

1479
01:33:25,293 --> 01:33:27,124
caught a glimpse
of him yourselves,

1480
01:33:27,228 --> 01:33:29,458
no doubt, last night.

1481
01:33:29,564 --> 01:33:33,227
He was staunch and
true little Tonga.

1482
01:33:33,334 --> 01:33:38,431
No man ever had a
more faithful mate.

1483
01:33:38,539 --> 01:33:40,439
Being by trade
a fisherman

1484
01:33:40,541 --> 01:33:42,805
he had a goodish
size native boat

1485
01:33:42,910 --> 01:33:45,936
and he had agreed to
try to escape with me.

1486
01:34:54,816 --> 01:34:57,512
After 1 0 days we were
picked up by a trader

1487
01:34:57,618 --> 01:35:01,611
with a cargo of
pilgrims from Malay
bound for Gito.

1488
01:35:01,723 --> 01:35:03,315
After many months

1489
01:35:03,424 --> 01:35:05,255
we worked our way
across the world

1490
01:35:05,360 --> 01:35:06,759
to London.

1491
01:35:11,499 --> 01:35:15,162
A remarkable account.

1492
01:35:15,269 --> 01:35:18,204
And now I think
Miss Morstan

1493
01:35:18,306 --> 01:35:21,503
might like to see the
Great Agra Treasure,

1494
01:35:21,609 --> 01:35:23,167
which will
surely make her

1495
01:35:23,277 --> 01:35:24,835
one of the richest young
ladies in England.

1496
01:35:24,946 --> 01:35:26,072
Watson?

1497
01:35:26,180 --> 01:35:26,976
There's no key.

1498
01:35:27,081 --> 01:35:29,709
I'm sure our iron
poker will oblige.

1499
01:35:56,077 --> 01:35:57,635
Ha ha ha ha ha ha

1500
01:36:03,918 --> 01:36:05,886
This is
your doing Small.

1501
01:36:05,987 --> 01:36:07,420
Yes.

1502
01:36:07,522 --> 01:36:09,149
Yes I put the
treasure away

1503
01:36:09,257 --> 01:36:12,351
where you shall never
lay a hand on it.

1504
01:36:12,460 --> 01:36:14,951
No living man or woman
has any right to it

1505
01:36:15,062 --> 01:36:16,461
unless it is the 3 men

1506
01:36:16,564 --> 01:36:20,523
in the Andaman Convict
Barracks and myself.

1507
01:36:20,635 --> 01:36:23,365
I know now that I cannot
have the use of it,

1508
01:36:23,471 --> 01:36:25,530
no more can they.

1509
01:36:25,640 --> 01:36:27,005
But I have acted all along

1510
01:36:27,108 --> 01:36:29,975
for them as much
as for myself.

1511
01:36:30,077 --> 01:36:33,877
We have the sign of
four with us always.

1512
01:36:33,981 --> 01:36:36,074
Where is it?

1513
01:36:36,184 --> 01:36:38,379
Where the key is

1514
01:36:38,486 --> 01:36:42,286
and where
little Tonga is.

1515
01:36:42,390 --> 01:36:43,880
I saw your launch
might catch us

1516
01:36:43,991 --> 01:36:49,395
and I saw little Tonga
go over the side.

1517
01:36:49,497 --> 01:36:51,965
I put the loot
in a safe place.

1518
01:36:52,066 --> 01:36:55,229
You are deceiving us
Small if you had wished

1519
01:36:55,336 --> 01:36:57,167
to throw the treasure
into the Thames

1520
01:36:57,271 --> 01:36:58,533
it would have been easier

1521
01:36:58,639 --> 01:37:00,163
to have thrown
box and all.

1522
01:37:00,274 --> 01:37:01,798
Easier for me to throw

1523
01:37:01,909 --> 01:37:05,208
and easier for
you to recover.

1524
01:37:05,313 --> 01:37:06,905
A man who's clever
enough to hunt me down

1525
01:37:07,014 --> 01:37:08,675
is clever enough
to pick up a box

1526
01:37:08,783 --> 01:37:11,343
from the bottom
of the river.

1527
01:37:14,956 --> 01:37:16,253
I am sorry.

1528
01:37:16,357 --> 01:37:20,054
I am glad the
treasure is lost.

1529
01:37:20,161 --> 01:37:22,095
It's been nothing
but a curse

1530
01:37:22,196 --> 01:37:25,131
to every man who
has owned it.

1531
01:37:25,233 --> 01:37:28,361
And only death to
my poor father.

1532
01:37:28,469 --> 01:37:29,527
And slavery for life

1533
01:37:29,637 --> 01:37:32,538
to me and my
companions.

1534
01:37:32,640 --> 01:37:34,039
We spent the first
half of my life

1535
01:37:34,141 --> 01:37:38,202
digging a breakwater
in the Andaman's.

1536
01:37:38,312 --> 01:37:40,109
And I'm likely to
spend the other half

1537
01:37:40,214 --> 01:37:45,345
digging ditches
on Dartmoor.

1538
01:37:45,453 --> 01:37:47,648
Well Holmes duty is duty

1539
01:37:47,755 --> 01:37:50,781
and I've gone rather far
in bringing him here.

1540
01:37:50,892 --> 01:37:52,883
I shall feel
more at ease

1541
01:37:52,994 --> 01:37:54,757
when I have our
storyteller here

1542
01:37:54,862 --> 01:37:56,454
under lock and key.

1543
01:37:56,564 --> 01:38:01,433
I am obliged to you
for your assistance.

1544
01:38:01,536 --> 01:38:03,333
Good day to you.
Doctor Watson,

1545
01:38:03,437 --> 01:38:05,268
Miss Morstan.

1546
01:38:09,610 --> 01:38:12,738
Awe, after you Small.

1547
01:38:12,847 --> 01:38:14,144
you seem a bit handy

1548
01:38:14,248 --> 01:38:16,478
with that wooden
leg of yours.

1549
01:39:01,395 --> 01:39:03,590
I feel most ashamed
that you Mr. Holmes

1550
01:39:03,698 --> 01:39:05,928
and you dear
Doctor Watson

1551
01:39:06,033 --> 01:39:07,330
have had to put yourself

1552
01:39:07,435 --> 01:39:09,062
into such peril
on my behalf.

1553
01:39:09,170 --> 01:39:11,104
Oh that's all over
and forgotten.

1554
01:39:11,205 --> 01:39:15,665
Mrs. Forrester has
sent her carriage
for Miss Morstan.

1555
01:39:15,776 --> 01:39:17,334
I'll impose on you
no longer gentlemen.

1556
01:39:17,445 --> 01:39:18,878
You must be exhausted.

1557
01:39:18,980 --> 01:39:20,743
Yes I confess
the reaction is
already upon me.

1558
01:39:20,848 --> 01:39:23,578
I shall be as limp
as a rag for a week.

1559
01:39:23,684 --> 01:39:25,151
I'm so very
grateful to you

1560
01:39:25,252 --> 01:39:27,550
for clearing my
father's name.

1561
01:39:29,557 --> 01:39:32,253
I'm so very grateful
to you both.

1562
01:39:54,248 --> 01:39:57,615
Seems so unfair.

1563
01:39:57,718 --> 01:39:59,743
You ve done all the
work in this business

1564
01:39:59,854 --> 01:40:02,880
and Athelney Jones
gets all the credit.

1565
01:40:05,726 --> 01:40:08,718
What remains for you?

1566
01:40:08,829 --> 01:40:10,694
For me, the pleasure
of having solved

1567
01:40:10,798 --> 01:40:14,427
an interesting case
almost single-handed.

1568
01:40:14,535 --> 01:40:17,527
And for you no
doubt the pleasure

1569
01:40:17,638 --> 01:40:19,401
of writing it up

1570
01:40:19,507 --> 01:40:24,467
in your usual flowery
and romantic style.

1571
01:41:00,915 --> 01:41:05,614
What a very
attractive woman.

1572
01:41:05,720 --> 01:41:07,984
Was she?

1573
01:41:08,089 --> 01:41:10,353
I hadn't noticed.

9999
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00
<font color="#ffff00" size=14>www.tvsubtitles.net</font>
